Analytics, Data Science, And AI

There are some projects I have done at MIT Applied Data Science Program as a student. Some original datasets are not available to the public. The purpose of this repo is to show my data science skills, such as importing and cleaning data, network analysis, time series analysis and data visualization.

See the details in Jupyter Notebook by clicking links.

## 1. Finance Data and Decision Tree Classification Analysis
* [Personal Loan Analysis](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Amberisfree/datascience.github.io/blob/main/Bank_loan_Analysis/bank_loan.html) The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans. Our bank wants a new marketing campaign; so that we need information about the correlation between the variables given in the dataset. The objective of this analysis is to utilize finance data to gain insights and make informed decisions in classifying our clients into our banks’ potential candidate for selling personal loans in the near future.
* Explored tree algorithms and ensembled methods, such as bagging, boosting, and random forests
* Anaylzed its ROC CURVE and Tuned its decision threshold.
* powered by MLR3

## 2. Affective AI and Facial Emotion Recognition with Deep Learning

* [Facial Emotion Recognition](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Amberisfree/datascience.github.io/blob/c7b8338f8652429e9c0ba01395e977b079f8055f/Affective_AI_Project.html): Develope an image-processing model to classify facial emotions accurately, such as sad, happy, neutral, and surprise from 20000+ dataset using convolutional neural network and achieved 80.02 accuracy.
* powered by Tensorflow

## 3. Regression Analysis on Gene Expression Profiles
* Lasso Reularization and PCA, residual Dignostic, 
* Non-parametric smoothing, Bootstrap confidence interval

## 4.Environment and Geo-Spatial Analysis
* Great Britain Tempertaure 
* Iceland Crust 

## 5.Bio-Statistic: Health Exploratory Data Analysis

* [Diabetes Analysis of PIMA Tribes](https://nbviewer.org/github/Amberisfree/datascience.github.io/blob/main/Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Analysis.ipynb?flush_cache=true): Finding risk factors and correlation patterns.
* [Free-Flap lower Extremilities Reconstruction analysis](): Data dimension reduction, visualization, segmentation of pateints

## 6. Art and Humanity: Shakespeare Network Analysis

* [Investigation into a time-varying Hamlet network](): Build a network of relationship between characters based on a player’s lines within each act 
* [Community Detection](): Identify Key figures in Evolution of the plot and Detect personas within each Community
