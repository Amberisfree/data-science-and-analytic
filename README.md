Analytics, Data Science, And AI

There are some projects I have done at MIT Applied Data Science Program as a student. Some original datasets are not available to the public. The purpose of this repo is to show my data science skills, such as importing and cleaning data, network analysis, time series analysis and data visualization.

See the details in Jupyter Notebook by clicking links.

## 1. Health Exploratory Data Analysis

* [Diabetes Analysis of PIMA Tribes](): Finding risk factors and correlation patterns.
* [Free-Flap lower Extremilities Reconstruction analysis](): Data dimension reduction, visualization, segmentation of pateints

## 2. Shakespeare Network Analysis

* [Investigation into a time-varying Hamlet network](): Build a network of relationship between characters based on a playerâ€™s lines within each act 
* [Community Detection](): Identify Key figures in Evolution of the plot and Detect personas within each Community

## 3. Affective AI and Deep Learning

* [Facial Emotion Recognition](): Develope an image-processing model to classify facial emotions accurately, such as sad, happy, neutral, and surprise from 20000+ dataset using convolutional neural network and achieved 80.02 accuracy.
