46,"ACT I. Scene I.
",ACT I.
47,"Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
",ACT I.
48,"
",ACT I.
49,"Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
",ACT I.
50,"at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].
",ACT I.
51,"
",ACT I.
52,"  Ber. Who's there.?
",ACT I.
53,"  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
",ACT I.
54,"  Ber. Long live the King!
",ACT I.
55,"  Fran. Bernardo?
",ACT I.
56,"  Ber. He.
",ACT I.
57,"  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
",ACT I.
58,"  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
",ACT I.
59,"  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
",ACT I.
60,"    And I am sick at heart.
",ACT I.
61,"  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
",ACT I.
62,"  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
",ACT I.
63,"  Ber. Well, good night.
",ACT I.
64,"    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
",ACT I.
65,"    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
",ACT I.
66,"
",ACT I.
67,"                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.  
",ACT I.
68,"
",ACT I.
69,"  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
",ACT I.
70,"  Hor. Friends to this ground.
",ACT I.
71,"  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
",ACT I.
72,"  Fran. Give you good night.
",ACT I.
73,"  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
",ACT I.
74,"    Who hath reliev'd you?
",ACT I.
75,"  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
",ACT I.
76,"    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
",ACT I.
77,"  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
",ACT I.
78,"  Ber. Say-
",ACT I.
79,"    What, is Horatio there ?
",ACT I.
80,"  Hor. A piece of him.
",ACT I.
81,"  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
",ACT I.
82,"  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
",ACT I.
83,"  Ber. I have seen nothing.
",ACT I.
84,"  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
",ACT I.
85,"    And will not let belief take hold of him
",ACT I.
86,"    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
",ACT I.
87,"    Therefore I have entreated him along,  
",ACT I.
88,"    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
",ACT I.
89,"    That, if again this apparition come,
",ACT I.
90,"    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
",ACT I.
91,"  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
",ACT I.
92,"  Ber. Sit down awhile,
",ACT I.
93,"    And let us once again assail your ears,
",ACT I.
94,"    That are so fortified against our story,
",ACT I.
95,"    What we two nights have seen.
",ACT I.
96,"  Hor. Well, sit we down,
",ACT I.
97,"    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
",ACT I.
98,"  Ber. Last night of all,
",ACT I.
99,"    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
",ACT I.
100,"    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
",ACT I.
101,"    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
",ACT I.
102,"    The bell then beating one-
",ACT I.
103,"
",ACT I.
104,"                        Enter Ghost.
",ACT I.
105,"
",ACT I.
106,"  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
",ACT I.
107,"  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
",ACT I.
108,"  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
",ACT I.
109,"  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
",ACT I.
110,"  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
",ACT I.
111,"  Ber. It would be spoke to.
",ACT I.
112,"  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
",ACT I.
113,"  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
",ACT I.
114,"    Together with that fair and warlike form
",ACT I.
115,"    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
",ACT I.
116,"    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
",ACT I.
117,"  Mar. It is offended.
",ACT I.
118,"  Ber. See, it stalks away!
",ACT I.
119,"  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
",ACT I.
120,"                                                     Exit Ghost.
",ACT I.
121,"  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
",ACT I.
122,"  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
",ACT I.
123,"    Is not this something more than fantasy?
",ACT I.
124,"    What think you on't?
",ACT I.
125,"  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
",ACT I.
126,"    Without the sensible and true avouch
",ACT I.
127,"    Of mine own eyes.  
",ACT I.
128,"  Mar. Is it not like the King?
",ACT I.
129,"  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
",ACT I.
130,"    Such was the very armour he had on
",ACT I.
131,"    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
",ACT I.
132,"    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
",ACT I.
133,"    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
",ACT I.
134,"    'Tis strange.
",ACT I.
135,"  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
",ACT I.
136,"    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
",ACT I.
137,"  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
",ACT I.
138,"    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
",ACT I.
139,"    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
",ACT I.
140,"  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
",ACT I.
141,"    Why this same strict and most observant watch
",ACT I.
142,"    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
",ACT I.
143,"    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
",ACT I.
144,"    And foreign mart for implements of war;
",ACT I.
145,"    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
",ACT I.
146,"    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
",ACT I.
147,"    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
",ACT I.
148,"    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
",ACT I.
149,"    Who is't that can inform me?
",ACT I.
150,"  Hor. That can I.
",ACT I.
151,"    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
",ACT I.
152,"    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
",ACT I.
153,"    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
",ACT I.
154,"    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
",ACT I.
155,"    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
",ACT I.
156,"    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
",ACT I.
157,"    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
",ACT I.
158,"    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
",ACT I.
159,"    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
",ACT I.
160,"    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
",ACT I.
161,"    Against the which a moiety competent
",ACT I.
162,"    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
",ACT I.
163,"    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
",ACT I.
164,"    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
",ACT I.
165,"    And carriage of the article design'd,
",ACT I.
166,"    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
",ACT I.
167,"    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
",ACT I.
168,"    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
",ACT I.
169,"    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
",ACT I.
170,"    For food and diet, to some enterprise
",ACT I.
171,"    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
",ACT I.
172,"    As it doth well appear unto our state,
",ACT I.
173,"    But to recover of us, by strong hand
",ACT I.
174,"    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
",ACT I.
175,"    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
",ACT I.
176,"    Is the main motive of our preparations,
",ACT I.
177,"    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
",ACT I.
178,"    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
",ACT I.
179,"  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
",ACT I.
180,"    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
",ACT I.
181,"    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
",ACT I.
182,"    That was and is the question of these wars.
",ACT I.
183,"  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
",ACT I.
184,"    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
",ACT I.
185,"    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
",ACT I.
186,"    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
",ACT I.
187,"    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
",ACT I.
188,"    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
",ACT I.
189,"    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
",ACT I.
190,"    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
",ACT I.
191,"    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
",ACT I.
192,"    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
",ACT I.
193,"    As harbingers preceding still the fates
",ACT I.
194,"    And prologue to the omen coming on,
",ACT I.
195,"    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
",ACT I.
196,"    Unto our climature and countrymen.
",ACT I.
197,"
",ACT I.
198,"                      Enter Ghost again.
",ACT I.
199,"
",ACT I.
200,"    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
",ACT I.
201,"    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
",ACT I.
202,"                                               Spreads his arms.
",ACT I.
203,"    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
",ACT I.
204,"    Speak to me.
",ACT I.
205,"    If there be any good thing to be done,
",ACT I.
206,"    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
",ACT I.
207,"    Speak to me.  
",ACT I.
208,"    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
",ACT I.
209,"    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
",ACT I.
210,"    O, speak!
",ACT I.
211,"    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
",ACT I.
212,"    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
",ACT I.
213,"    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
",ACT I.
214,"                                                 The cock crows.
",ACT I.
215,"    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
",ACT I.
216,"  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
",ACT I.
217,"  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
",ACT I.
218,"  Ber. 'Tis here!
",ACT I.
219,"  Hor. 'Tis here!
",ACT I.
220,"  Mar. 'Tis gone!
",ACT I.
221,"                                                     Exit Ghost.
",ACT I.
222,"    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
",ACT I.
223,"    To offer it the show of violence;
",ACT I.
224,"    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
",ACT I.
225,"    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
",ACT I.
226,"  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
",ACT I.
227,"  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
",ACT I.
228,"    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
",ACT I.
229,"    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
",ACT I.
230,"    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
",ACT I.
231,"    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
",ACT I.
232,"    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
",ACT I.
233,"    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
",ACT I.
234,"    To his confine; and of the truth herein
",ACT I.
235,"    This present object made probation.
",ACT I.
236,"  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
",ACT I.
237,"    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
",ACT I.
238,"    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
",ACT I.
239,"    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
",ACT I.
240,"    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
",ACT I.
241,"    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
",ACT I.
242,"    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
",ACT I.
243,"    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
",ACT I.
244,"  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
",ACT I.
245,"    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
",ACT I.
246,"    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
",ACT I.
247,"    Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
",ACT I.
248,"    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
",ACT I.
249,"    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
",ACT I.
250,"    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
",ACT I.
251,"    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
",ACT I.
252,"    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
",ACT I.
253,"    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
",ACT I.
254,"    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
",ACT I.
255,"
",ACT I.
256,"
",ACT I.
257,"
",ACT I.
258,"
",ACT I.
259,"Scene II.
",ACT I.
260,"Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
",ACT I.
261,"
",ACT I.
262,"Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,
",ACT I.
263,"Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
",ACT I.
264,"Lords Attendant.
",ACT I.
265,"
",ACT I.
266,"  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
",ACT I.
267,"    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
",ACT I.
268,"    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
",ACT I.
269,"    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
",ACT I.
270,"    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
",ACT I.
271,"    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
",ACT I.
272,"    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
",ACT I.
273,"    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
",ACT I.
274,"    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
",ACT I.
275,"    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
",ACT I.
276,"    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
",ACT I.
277,"    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
",ACT I.
278,"    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
",ACT I.
279,"    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
",ACT I.
280,"    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
",ACT I.
281,"    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
",ACT I.
282,"    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
",ACT I.
283,"    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
",ACT I.
284,"    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
",ACT I.
285,"    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
",ACT I.
286,"    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
",ACT I.
287,"    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
",ACT I.
288,"    Importing the surrender of those lands
",ACT I.
289,"    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
",ACT I.
290,"    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
",ACT I.
291,"    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
",ACT I.
292,"    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
",ACT I.
293,"    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
",ACT I.
294,"    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
",ACT I.
295,"    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
",ACT I.
296,"    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
",ACT I.
297,"    The lists, and full proportions are all made
",ACT I.
298,"    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
",ACT I.
299,"    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
",ACT I.
300,"    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
",ACT I.
301,"    Giving to you no further personal power
",ACT I.
302,"    To business with the King, more than the scope
",ACT I.
303,"    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
",ACT I.
304,"    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
",ACT I.
305,"  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
",ACT I.
306,"  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
",ACT I.
307,"                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
",ACT I.
308,"    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
",ACT I.
309,"    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
",ACT I.
310,"    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
",ACT I.
311,"    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
",ACT I.
312,"    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
",ACT I.
313,"    The head is not more native to the heart,
",ACT I.
314,"    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
",ACT I.
315,"    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
",ACT I.
316,"    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
",ACT I.
317,"  Laer. My dread lord,
",ACT I.
318,"    Your leave and favour to return to France;
",ACT I.
319,"    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
",ACT I.
320,"    To show my duty in your coronation,  
",ACT I.
321,"    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
",ACT I.
322,"    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
",ACT I.
323,"    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
",ACT I.
324,"  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
",ACT I.
325,"  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
",ACT I.
326,"    By laboursome petition, and at last
",ACT I.
327,"    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
",ACT I.
328,"    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
",ACT I.
329,"  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
",ACT I.
330,"    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
",ACT I.
331,"    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
",ACT I.
332,"  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
",ACT I.
333,"  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
",ACT I.
334,"  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
",ACT I.
335,"  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
",ACT I.
336,"    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
",ACT I.
337,"    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
",ACT I.
338,"    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
",ACT I.
339,"    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
",ACT I.
340,"    Passing through nature to eternity.  
",ACT I.
341,"  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
",ACT I.
342,"  Queen. If it be,
",ACT I.
343,"    Why seems it so particular with thee?
",ACT I.
344,"  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
",ACT I.
345,"    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
",ACT I.
346,"    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
",ACT I.
347,"    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
",ACT I.
348,"    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
",ACT I.
349,"    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
",ACT I.
350,"    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
",ACT I.
351,"    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
",ACT I.
352,"    For they are actions that a man might play;
",ACT I.
353,"    But I have that within which passeth show-
",ACT I.
354,"    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
",ACT I.
355,"  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
",ACT I.
356,"    To give these mourning duties to your father;
",ACT I.
357,"    But you must know, your father lost a father;
",ACT I.
358,"    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
",ACT I.
359,"    In filial obligation for some term
",ACT I.
360,"    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  
",ACT I.
361,"    In obstinate condolement is a course
",ACT I.
362,"    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
",ACT I.
363,"    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
",ACT I.
364,"    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
",ACT I.
365,"    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
",ACT I.
366,"    For what we know must be, and is as common
",ACT I.
367,"    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
",ACT I.
368,"    Why should we in our peevish opposition
",ACT I.
369,"    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
",ACT I.
370,"    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
",ACT I.
371,"    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
",ACT I.
372,"    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
",ACT I.
373,"    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
",ACT I.
374,"    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
",ACT I.
375,"    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
",ACT I.
376,"    As of a father; for let the world take note
",ACT I.
377,"    You are the most immediate to our throne,
",ACT I.
378,"    And with no less nobility of love
",ACT I.
379,"    Than that which dearest father bears his son
",ACT I.
380,"    Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
",ACT I.
381,"    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
",ACT I.
382,"    It is most retrograde to our desire;
",ACT I.
383,"    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
",ACT I.
384,"    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
",ACT I.
385,"    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
",ACT I.
386,"  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
",ACT I.
387,"    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
",ACT I.
388,"  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
",ACT I.
389,"  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
",ACT I.
390,"    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
",ACT I.
391,"    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
",ACT I.
392,"    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
",ACT I.
393,"    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
",ACT I.
394,"    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
",ACT I.
395,"    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
",ACT I.
396,"    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
",ACT I.
397,"                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
",ACT I.
398,"  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
",ACT I.
399,"    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
",ACT I.
400,"    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
",ACT I.
401,"    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
",ACT I.
402,"    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
",ACT I.
403,"    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
",ACT I.
404,"    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
",ACT I.
405,"    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
",ACT I.
406,"    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
",ACT I.
407,"    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
",ACT I.
408,"    So excellent a king, that was to this
",ACT I.
409,"    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
",ACT I.
410,"    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
",ACT I.
411,"    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
",ACT I.
412,"    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
",ACT I.
413,"    As if increase of appetite had grown
",ACT I.
414,"    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
",ACT I.
415,"    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
",ACT I.
416,"    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
",ACT I.
417,"    With which she followed my poor father's body
",ACT I.
418,"    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
",ACT I.
419,"    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
",ACT I.
420,"    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  
",ACT I.
421,"    My father's brother, but no more like my father
",ACT I.
422,"    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
",ACT I.
423,"    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
",ACT I.
424,"    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
",ACT I.
425,"    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
",ACT I.
426,"    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
",ACT I.
427,"    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
",ACT I.
428,"    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
",ACT I.
429,"
",ACT I.
430,"          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.
",ACT I.
431,"
",ACT I.
432,"  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
",ACT I.
433,"  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
",ACT I.
434,"    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
",ACT I.
435,"  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
",ACT I.
436,"  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
",ACT I.
437,"    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
",ACT I.
438,"    Marcellus?
",ACT I.
439,"  Mar. My good lord!
",ACT I.
440,"  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
",ACT I.
441,"    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
",ACT I.
442,"  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
",ACT I.
443,"  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
",ACT I.
444,"    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
",ACT I.
445,"    To make it truster of your own report
",ACT I.
446,"    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
",ACT I.
447,"    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
",ACT I.
448,"    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
",ACT I.
449,"  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
",ACT I.
450,"  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
",ACT I.
451,"    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
",ACT I.
452,"  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
",ACT I.
453,"  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
",ACT I.
454,"    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
",ACT I.
455,"    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
",ACT I.
456,"    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
",ACT I.
457,"    My father- methinks I see my father.
",ACT I.
458,"  Hor. O, where, my lord?
",ACT I.
459,"  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
",ACT I.
460,"  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
",ACT I.
461,"  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
",ACT I.
462,"    I shall not look upon his like again.
",ACT I.
463,"  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
",ACT I.
464,"  Ham. Saw? who?
",ACT I.
465,"  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
",ACT I.
466,"  Ham. The King my father?
",ACT I.
467,"  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
",ACT I.
468,"    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
",ACT I.
469,"    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
",ACT I.
470,"    This marvel to you.
",ACT I.
471,"  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
",ACT I.
472,"  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
",ACT I.
473,"    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
",ACT I.
474,"    In the dead vast and middle of the night
",ACT I.
475,"    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
",ACT I.
476,"    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
",ACT I.
477,"    Appears before them and with solemn march
",ACT I.
478,"    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
",ACT I.
479,"    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
",ACT I.
480,"    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
",ACT I.
481,"    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
",ACT I.
482,"    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
",ACT I.
483,"    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
",ACT I.
484,"    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
",ACT I.
485,"    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
",ACT I.
486,"    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
",ACT I.
487,"    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
",ACT I.
488,"    These hands are not more like.
",ACT I.
489,"  Ham. But where was this?
",ACT I.
490,"  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
",ACT I.
491,"  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
",ACT I.
492,"  Hor. My lord, I did;
",ACT I.
493,"    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
",ACT I.
494,"    It lifted up it head and did address
",ACT I.
495,"    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
",ACT I.
496,"    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
",ACT I.
497,"    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
",ACT I.
498,"    And vanish'd from our sight.
",ACT I.
499,"  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
",ACT I.
500,"  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
",ACT I.
501,"    And we did think it writ down in our duty
",ACT I.
502,"    To let you know of it.
",ACT I.
503,"  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
",ACT I.
504,"    Hold you the watch to-night?
",ACT I.
505,"  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
",ACT I.
506,"  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
",ACT I.
507,"  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
",ACT I.
508,"  Ham. From top to toe?
",ACT I.
509,"  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
",ACT I.
510,"  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
",ACT I.
511,"  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
",ACT I.
512,"  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
",ACT I.
513,"  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
",ACT I.
514,"  Ham. Pale or red?
",ACT I.
515,"  Hor. Nay, very pale.
",ACT I.
516,"  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
",ACT I.
517,"  Hor. Most constantly.
",ACT I.
518,"  Ham. I would I had been there.
",ACT I.
519,"  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
",ACT I.
520,"  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
",ACT I.
521,"  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
",ACT I.
522,"  Both. Longer, longer.
",ACT I.
523,"  Hor. Not when I saw't.
",ACT I.
524,"  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
",ACT I.
525,"  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
",ACT I.
526,"    A sable silver'd.
",ACT I.
527,"  Ham. I will watch to-night.
",ACT I.
528,"    Perchance 'twill walk again.
",ACT I.
529,"  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
",ACT I.
530,"  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
",ACT I.
531,"    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
",ACT I.
532,"    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
",ACT I.
533,"    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
",ACT I.
534,"    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
",ACT I.
535,"    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
",ACT I.
536,"    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
",ACT I.
537,"    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
",ACT I.
538,"    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
",ACT I.
539,"    I'll visit you.
",ACT I.
540,"  All. Our duty to your honour.  
",ACT I.
541,"  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
",ACT I.
542,"                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
",ACT I.
543,"    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
",ACT I.
544,"    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
",ACT I.
545,"    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
",ACT I.
546,"    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
",ACT I.
547,"Exit.
",ACT I.
548,"
",ACT I.
549,"
",ACT I.
550,"
",ACT I.
551,"
",ACT I.
552,"Scene III.
",ACT I.
553,"Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.
",ACT I.
554,"
",ACT I.
555,"Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
",ACT I.
556,"
",ACT I.
557,"  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
",ACT I.
558,"    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
",ACT I.
559,"    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
",ACT I.
560,"    But let me hear from you.
",ACT I.
561,"  Oph. Do you doubt that?
",ACT I.
562,"  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
",ACT I.
563,"    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
",ACT I.
564,"    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
",ACT I.
565,"    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
",ACT I.
566,"    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
",ACT I.
567,"    No more.
",ACT I.
568,"  Oph. No more but so?
",ACT I.
569,"  Laer. Think it no more.
",ACT I.
570,"    For nature crescent does not grow alone
",ACT I.
571,"    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
",ACT I.
572,"    The inward service of the mind and soul
",ACT I.
573,"    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
",ACT I.
574,"    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
",ACT I.
575,"    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
",ACT I.
576,"    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
",ACT I.
577,"    For he himself is subject to his birth.
",ACT I.
578,"    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
",ACT I.
579,"    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
",ACT I.
580,"    The safety and health of this whole state,
",ACT I.
581,"    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
",ACT I.
582,"    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
",ACT I.
583,"    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
",ACT I.
584,"    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
",ACT I.
585,"    As he in his particular act and place
",ACT I.
586,"    May give his saying deed; which is no further
",ACT I.
587,"    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
",ACT I.
588,"    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
",ACT I.
589,"    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
",ACT I.
590,"    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
",ACT I.
591,"    To his unmast'red importunity.
",ACT I.
592,"    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
",ACT I.
593,"    And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
",ACT I.
594,"    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
",ACT I.
595,"    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
",ACT I.
596,"    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
",ACT I.
597,"    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
",ACT I.
598,"    The canker galls the infants of the spring
",ACT I.
599,"    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
",ACT I.
600,"    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
",ACT I.
601,"    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
",ACT I.
602,"    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
",ACT I.
603,"    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
",ACT I.
604,"  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
",ACT I.
605,"    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
",ACT I.
606,"    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
",ACT I.
607,"    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
",ACT I.
608,"    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
",ACT I.
609,"    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
",ACT I.
610,"    And recks not his own rede.
",ACT I.
611,"  Laer. O, fear me not!
",ACT I.
612,"
",ACT I.
613,"                       Enter Polonius.  
",ACT I.
614,"
",ACT I.
615,"    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
",ACT I.
616,"    A double blessing is a double grace;
",ACT I.
617,"    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
",ACT I.
618,"  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
",ACT I.
619,"    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
",ACT I.
620,"    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
",ACT I.
621,"    And these few precepts in thy memory
",ACT I.
622,"    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
",ACT I.
623,"    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
",ACT I.
624,"    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
",ACT I.
625,"    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
",ACT I.
626,"    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
",ACT I.
627,"    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
",ACT I.
628,"    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
",ACT I.
629,"    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
",ACT I.
630,"    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
",ACT I.
631,"    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
",ACT I.
632,"    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
",ACT I.
633,"    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
",ACT I.
634,"    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
",ACT I.
635,"    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
",ACT I.
636,"    And they in France of the best rank and station
",ACT I.
637,"    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
",ACT I.
638,"    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
",ACT I.
639,"    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
",ACT I.
640,"    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
",ACT I.
641,"    This above all- to thine own self be true,
",ACT I.
642,"    And it must follow, as the night the day,
",ACT I.
643,"    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
",ACT I.
644,"    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
",ACT I.
645,"  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
",ACT I.
646,"  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
",ACT I.
647,"  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
",ACT I.
648,"    What I have said to you.
",ACT I.
649,"  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
",ACT I.
650,"    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
",ACT I.
651,"  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
",ACT I.
652,"  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
",ACT I.
653,"  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  
",ACT I.
654,"  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
",ACT I.
655,"    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
",ACT I.
656,"    Given private time to you, and you yourself
",ACT I.
657,"    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
",ACT I.
658,"    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
",ACT I.
659,"    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
",ACT I.
660,"    You do not understand yourself so clearly
",ACT I.
661,"    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
",ACT I.
662,"    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
",ACT I.
663,"  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
",ACT I.
664,"    Of his affection to me.
",ACT I.
665,"  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
",ACT I.
666,"    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
",ACT I.
667,"    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
",ACT I.
668,"  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
",ACT I.
669,"  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
",ACT I.
670,"    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
",ACT I.
671,"    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
",ACT I.
672,"    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
",ACT I.
673,"    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  
",ACT I.
674,"  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
",ACT I.
675,"    In honourable fashion.
",ACT I.
676,"  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
",ACT I.
677,"  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
",ACT I.
678,"    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
",ACT I.
679,"  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
",ACT I.
680,"    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
",ACT I.
681,"    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
",ACT I.
682,"    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
",ACT I.
683,"    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
",ACT I.
684,"    You must not take for fire. From this time
",ACT I.
685,"    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
",ACT I.
686,"    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
",ACT I.
687,"    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
",ACT I.
688,"    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
",ACT I.
689,"    And with a larger tether may he walk
",ACT I.
690,"    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
",ACT I.
691,"    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
",ACT I.
692,"    Not of that dye which their investments show,
",ACT I.
693,"    But mere implorators of unholy suits,  
",ACT I.
694,"    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
",ACT I.
695,"    The better to beguile. This is for all:
",ACT I.
696,"    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
",ACT I.
697,"    Have you so slander any moment leisure
",ACT I.
698,"    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
",ACT I.
699,"    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
",ACT I.
700,"  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
",ACT I.
701,"                                                         Exeunt.

708,"
",ACT I.
709,"Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.
",ACT I.
710,"
",ACT I.
711,"  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
",ACT I.
712,"  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
",ACT I.
713,"  Ham. What hour now?
",ACT I.
714,"  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
",ACT I.
715,"  Mar. No, it is struck.
",ACT I.
716,"  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
",ACT I.
717,"    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
",ACT I.
718,"                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
",ACT I.
719,"    What does this mean, my lord?
",ACT I.
720,"  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
",ACT I.
721,"    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
",ACT I.
722,"    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,

724,"    The triumph of his pledge.
",ACT I.
725,"  Hor. Is it a custom?
",ACT I.
726,"  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
",ACT I.
727,"    But to my mind, though I am native here  
",ACT I.
728,"    And to the manner born, it is a custom
",ACT I.
729,"    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
",ACT I.
730,"    This heavy-headed revel east and west
",ACT I.
731,"    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;

",ACT I.
733,"    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
",ACT I.
734,"    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
",ACT I.
735,"    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
",ACT I.
736,"    So oft it chances in particular men
",ACT I.
737,"    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
",ACT I.
738,"    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
",ACT I.
739,"    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
",ACT I.
740,"    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
",ACT I.
741,"    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,

746,"    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
",ACT I.
747,"    As infinite as man may undergo-  
",ACT I.
748,"    Shall in the general censure take corruption
",ACT I.
749,"    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il

",ACT I.
754,"  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
",ACT I.
755,"  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
",ACT I.
756,"    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
",ACT I.
757,"    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
",ACT I.
758,"    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
",ACT I.
759,"    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
",ACT I.
760,"    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
",ACT I.
761,"    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
",ACT I.
762,"    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
",ACT I.
763,"    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
",ACT I.
764,"    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
",ACT I.
765,"    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
",ACT I.
766,"    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
",ACT I.
767,"    To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
",ACT I.
768,"    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
",ACT I.
769,"    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
",ACT I.
770,"    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
",ACT I.
771,"    So horridly to shake our disposition
",ACT I.
772,"    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
",ACT I.
773,"    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
",ACT I.
774,"                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
",ACT I.
775,"  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
",ACT I.
776,"    As if it some impartment did desire
",ACT I.
777,"    To you alone.
",ACT I.
778,"  Mar. Look with what courteous action
",ACT I.
779,"    It waves you to a more removed ground.
",ACT I.
780,"    But do not go with it!
",ACT I.
781,"  Hor. No, by no means!
",ACT I.
782,"  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
",ACT I.
783,"  Hor. Do not, my lord!
",ACT I.
784,"  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
",ACT I.
785,"    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
",ACT I.
786,"    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
",ACT I.
787,"    Being a thing immortal as itself?  
",ACT I.
788,"    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
",ACT I.
789,"  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
",ACT I.
790,"    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
",ACT I.
791,"    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
",ACT I.
792,"    And there assume some other, horrible form
",ACT I.
793,"    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
",ACT I.
794,"    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
",ACT I.
795,"    The very place puts toys of desperation,
",ACT I.
796,"    Without more motive, into every brain
",ACT I.
797,"    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
",ACT I.
798,"    And hears it roar beneath.
",ACT I.
799,"  Ham. It waves me still.
",ACT I.
800,"    Go on. I'll follow thee.
",ACT I.
801,"  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
",ACT I.
802,"  Ham. Hold off your hands!
",ACT I.
803,"  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
",ACT I.
804,"  Ham. My fate cries out
",ACT I.
805,"    And makes each petty artire in this body
",ACT I.
806,"    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
",ACT I.
807,"                                                [Ghost beckons.]  
",ACT I.
808,"    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
",ACT I.
809,"    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
",ACT I.
810,"    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
",ACT I.
811,"                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
",ACT I.
812,"  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
",ACT I.
813,"  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
",ACT I.
814,"  Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
",ACT I.
815,"  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
",ACT I.
816,"  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
",ACT I.
817,"  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
",ACT I.
818,"                                                         Exeunt.

",ACT I.
831,"  Ghost. My hour is almost come,

832,"    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
",ACT I.
833,"    Must render up myself.
",ACT I.
834,"  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
",ACT I.
835,"  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
",ACT I.
836,"    To what I shall unfold.
",ACT I.
837,"  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
",ACT I.
838,"  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
",ACT I.
839,"  Ham. What?
",ACT I.
840,"  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,

841,"    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,

",ACT I.
845,"    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
",ACT I.
846,"    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
",ACT I.
847,"    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,

854,"    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
",ACT I.

",ACT I.
856,"  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
",ACT I.
857,"  Ham. Murther?
",ACT I.
858,"  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
",ACT I.
859,"    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
",ACT I.
860,"  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
",ACT I.
861,"    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
",ACT I.

",ACT I.

",ACT I.
867,"    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,

868,"    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
",ACT I.

870,"    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
",ACT I.
871,"    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
",ACT I.
872,"    Now wears his crown.
",ACT I.
873,"  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
",ACT I.
874,"    My uncle?
",ACT I.
875,"  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
",ACT I.
876,"    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
",ACT I.
877,"    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
",ACT I.
878,"    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
",ACT I.
879,"    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
",ACT I.
880,"    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
",ACT I.
881,"    From me, whose love was of that dignity
",ACT I.
882,"    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
",ACT I.

",ACT I.
884,"    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
",ACT I.
885,"    To those of mine!
",ACT I.
886,"    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
",ACT I.
887,"    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
",ACT I.
888,"    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
",ACT I.
889,"    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
",ACT I.
890,"    And prey on garbage.
",ACT I.
891,"    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
",ACT I.
892,"    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
",ACT I.
893,"    My custom always of the afternoon,
",ACT I.
894,"    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
",ACT I.
895,"    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
",ACT I.
896,"    And in the porches of my ears did pour
",ACT I.
897,"    The leperous distilment; whose effect
",ACT I.
898,"    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
",ACT I.
899,"    That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
",ACT I.
900,"    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
",ACT I.
901,"    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
",ACT I.
902,"    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
",ACT I.
903,"    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
",ACT I.
904,"    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
",ACT I.
905,"    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
",ACT I.
906,"    All my smooth body.
",ACT I.
907,"    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
",ACT I.
908,"    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
",ACT I.
909,"    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
",ACT I.
910,"    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
",ACT I.
911,"    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
",ACT I.
912,"    With all my imperfections on my head.
",ACT I.
913,"  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
",ACT I.
914,"  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
",ACT I.
915,"    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
",ACT I.
916,"    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
",ACT I.
917,"    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
",ACT I.
918,"    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
",ACT I.
919,"    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
",ACT I.
920,"    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
",ACT I.
921,"    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
",ACT I.
922,"    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
",ACT I.
923,"    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
",ACT I.
924,"    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.  
",ACT I.
925,"  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
",ACT I.
926,"    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
",ACT I.
927,"    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
",ACT I.
928,"    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
",ACT I.
929,"    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
",ACT I.
930,"    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
",ACT I.
931,"    Yea, from the table of my memory
",ACT I.
932,"    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
",ACT I.
933,"    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
",ACT I.
934,"    That youth and observation copied there,
",ACT I.
935,"    And thy commandment all alone shall live
",ACT I.
936,"    Within the book and volume of my brain,
",ACT I.
937,"    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
",ACT I.
938,"    O most pernicious woman!
",ACT I.
939,"    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
",ACT I.
940,"    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
",ACT I.
941,"    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
",ACT I.
942,"    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
",ACT I.
943,"    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
",ACT I.
944,"    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
",ACT I.
945,"    I have sworn't.
",ACT I.
946,"  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
",ACT I.
947,"
",ACT I.
948,"                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
",ACT I.
949,"
",ACT I.
950,"  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
",ACT I.
951,"  Hor. Heaven secure him!
",ACT I.
952,"  Ham. So be it!
",ACT I.
953,"  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
",ACT I.
954,"  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
",ACT I.
955,"  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
",ACT I.
956,"  Hor. What news, my lord?
",ACT I.
957,"  Mar. O, wonderful!
",ACT I.
958,"  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
",ACT I.
959,"  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
",ACT I.
960,"  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
",ACT I.
961,"  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
",ACT I.
962,"  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
",ACT I.
963,"    But you'll be secret?
",ACT I.
964,"  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  
",ACT I.
965,"  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
",ACT I.
966,"    But he's an arrant knave.
",ACT I.
967,"  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
",ACT I.
968,"    To tell us this.
",ACT I.
969,"  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
",ACT I.
970,"    And so, without more circumstance at all,
",ACT I.
971,"    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
",ACT I.
972,"    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
",ACT I.
973,"    For every man hath business and desire,
",ACT I.
974,"    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
",ACT I.
975,"    Look you, I'll go pray.
",ACT I.
976,"  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
",ACT I.
977,"  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
",ACT I.
978,"    Yes, faith, heartily.
",ACT I.
979,"  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
",ACT I.
980,"  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
",ACT I.
981,"    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
",ACT I.
982,"    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
",ACT I.
983,"    For your desire to know what is between us,
",ACT I.
984,"    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,  
",ACT I.
985,"    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
",ACT I.
986,"    Give me one poor request.
",ACT I.
987,"  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
",ACT I.
988,"  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
",ACT I.
989,"  Both. My lord, we will not.
",ACT I.
990,"  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
",ACT I.
991,"  Hor. In faith,
",ACT I.
992,"    My lord, not I.
",ACT I.
993,"  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
",ACT I.
994,"  Ham. Upon my sword.
",ACT I.
995,"  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
",ACT I.
996,"  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
",ACT I.
997,"
",ACT I.
998,"                 Ghost cries under the stage.
",ACT I.
999,"
",ACT I.

",ACT I.
1001,"  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
",ACT I.
1002,"    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
",ACT I.
1003,"    Consent to swear.
",ACT I.
1004,"  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.  
",ACT I.
1005,"  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
",ACT I.
1006,"    Swear by my sword.
",ACT I.
1007,"  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
",ACT I.
1008,"  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
",ACT I.
1009,"    Come hither, gentlemen,
",ACT I.
1010,"    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
",ACT I.
1011,"    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
",ACT I.
1012,"    Swear by my sword.
",ACT I.
1013,"  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
",ACT I.
1014,"  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
",ACT I.
1015,"    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.""
",ACT I.
1016,"  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
",ACT I.
1017,"  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
",ACT I.
1018,"    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
",ACT I.
1019,"    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
",ACT I.
1020,"    But come!
",ACT I.
1021,"    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
",ACT I.
1022,"    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
",ACT I.
1023,"    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
",ACT I.
1024,"    To put an antic disposition on),  
",ACT I.
1025,"    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
",ACT I.
1026,"    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
",ACT I.
1027,"    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
",ACT I.
1028,"    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
",ACT I.
1029,"    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
",ACT I.
1030,"    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
",ACT I.
1031,"    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
",ACT I.
1032,"    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
",ACT I.
1033,"    Swear.
",ACT I.
1034,"  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.

",ACT I.
1036,"  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
",ACT I.
1037,"    With all my love I do commend me to you;
",ACT I.
1038,"    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
",ACT I.
1039,"    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
",ACT I.
1040,"    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
",ACT I.
1041,"    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
",ACT I.
1042,"    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
",ACT I.
1043,"    That ever I was born to set it right!
",ACT I.
1044,"    Nay, come, let's go together.  
",ACT I.
1045,"                                                         Exeunt.

",ACT II.
1054,"

1056,"  Rey. I will, my lord.
",ACT II.
1057,"  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
",ACT II.
1058,"    Before You visit him, to make inquire
",ACT II.
1059,"    Of his behaviour.
",ACT II.
1060,"  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
",ACT II.
1061,"  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
",ACT II.
1062,"    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
",ACT II.
1063,"    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
",ACT II.
1064,"    What company, at what expense; and finding
",ACT II.
1065,"    By this encompassment and drift of question
",ACT II.
1066,"    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
",ACT II.
1067,"    Than your particular demands will touch it.
",ACT II.
1068,"    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
",ACT II.
1069,"    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
",ACT II.
1070,"    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
",ACT II.
1071,"  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.  
",ACT II.
1072,"  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
",ACT II.
1073,"    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
",ACT II.
1074,"    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
",ACT II.
1075,"    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
",ACT II.
1076,"    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
",ACT II.
1077,"    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
",ACT II.
1078,"    As are companions noted and most known
",ACT II.
1079,"    To youth and liberty.
",ACT II.
1080,"  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
",ACT II.
1081,"  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
",ACT II.
1082,"    Drabbing. You may go so far.
",ACT II.
1083,"  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
",ACT II.
1084,"  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
",ACT II.
1085,"    You must not put another scandal on him,
",ACT II.
1086,"    That he is open to incontinency.
",ACT II.
1087,"    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
",ACT II.
1088,"    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
",ACT II.
1089,"    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
",ACT II.
1090,"    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
",ACT II.
1091,"    Of general assault.  
",ACT II.
1092,"  Rey. But, my good lord-
",ACT II.
1093,"  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
",ACT II.
1094,"  Rey. Ay, my lord,
",ACT II.
1095,"    I would know that.
",ACT II.
1096,"  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
",ACT II.
1097,"    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
",ACT II.
1098,"    You laying these slight sullies on my son
",ACT II.
1099,"    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
",ACT II.
1100,"    Mark you,
",ACT II.
1101,"    Your party in converse, him you would sound,

1102,"    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
",ACT II.
1103,"    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
",ACT II.
1104,"    He closes with you in this consequence:
",ACT II.
1105,"    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
",ACT II.
1106,"    According to the phrase or the addition
",ACT II.
1107,"    Of man and country-
",ACT II.
1108,"  Rey. Very good, my lord.
",ACT II.
1109,"  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
",ACT II.
1110,"    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
",ACT II.
1111,"  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and  
",ACT II.
1112,"    gentleman.'
",ACT II.
1113,"  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
",ACT II.
1114,"    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
",ACT II.
1115,"    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
",ACT II.
1116,"    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
",ACT II.
1117,"    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
",ACT II.
1118,"    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
",ACT II.
1119,"    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
",ACT II.
1120,"    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
",ACT II.
1121,"    See you now-
",ACT II.
1122,"    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
",ACT II.
1123,"    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
",ACT II.
1124,"    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
",ACT II.
1125,"    By indirections find directions out.
",ACT II.
1126,"    So, by my former lecture and advice,

1127,"    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not

1128,"  Rey. My lord, I have.
",ACT II.
1129,"  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
",ACT II.
1130,"  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
",ACT II.
1131,"  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
",ACT II.
1132,"  Rey. I shall, my lord.
",ACT II.
1133,"  Pol. And let him ply his music.
",ACT II.
1134,"  Rey. Well, my lord.
",ACT II.
1135,"  Pol. Farewell!

",ACT II.
1139,"
",ACT II.
1140,"    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
",ACT II.
1141,"  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
",ACT II.
1142,"  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
",ACT II.
1143,"  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
",ACT II.
1144,"    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
",ACT II.
1145,"    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
",ACT II.
1146,"    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
",ACT II.
1147,"    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
",ACT II.
1148,"    And with a look so piteous in purport
",ACT II.
1149,"    As if he had been loosed out of hell
",ACT II.
1150,"    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
",ACT II.
1151,"  Pol. Mad for thy love?  
",ACT II.
1152,"  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
",ACT II.
1153,"    But truly I do fear it.
",ACT II.
1154,"  Pol. What said he?
",ACT II.
1155,"  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
",ACT II.
1156,"    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
",ACT II.
1157,"    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
",ACT II.
1158,"    He falls to such perusal of my face
",ACT II.
1159,"    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
",ACT II.
1160,"    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
",ACT II.
1161,"    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
",ACT II.
1162,"    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
",ACT II.
1163,"    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
",ACT II.
1164,"    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
",ACT II.
1165,"    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
",ACT II.
1166,"    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
",ACT II.
1167,"    For out o' doors he went without their help
",ACT II.
1168,"    And to the last bended their light on me.
",ACT II.
1169,"  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
",ACT II.
1170,"    This is the very ecstasy of love,
",ACT II.
1171,"    Whose violent property fordoes itself  
",ACT II.
1172,"    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
",ACT II.
1173,"    As oft as any passion under heaven
",ACT II.
1174,"    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
",ACT II.
1175,"    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
",ACT II.
1176,"  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
",ACT II.
1177,"    I did repel his letters and denied
",ACT II.
1178,"    His access to me.
",ACT II.
1179,"  Pol. That hath made him mad.
",ACT II.
1180,"    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
",ACT II.
1181,"    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
",ACT II.
1182,"    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
",ACT II.
1183,"    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
",ACT II.
1184,"    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
",ACT II.
1185,"    As it is common for the younger sort
",ACT II.
1186,"    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
",ACT II.
1187,"    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
",ACT II.
1188,"    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
",ACT II.
1189,"    Come.
",ACT II.
1190,"                                                         Exeunt.

",ACT II.
1198,"    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
",ACT II.
1199,"    The need we have to use you did provoke
",ACT II.

",ACT II.
1212,"    So much as from occasion you may glean,  
",ACT II.
1213,"    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
",ACT II.
1214,"    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

1224,"    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,

",ACT II.
1251,"    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
",ACT II.
1252,"    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found  
",ACT II.
1253,"    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
",ACT II.
1254,"  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
",ACT II.
1255,"  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
",ACT II.
1256,"    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

",ACT II.
1261,"  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
",ACT II.

",ACT II.
1263,"  King. Well, we shall sift him.

",ACT II.
1267,"    Welcome, my good friends.
",ACT II.
1268,"    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
",ACT II.
1269,"  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
",ACT II.
1270,"    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
",ACT II.
1271,"    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
",ACT II.
1272,"    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,  
",ACT II.
1273,"    But better look'd into, he truly found
",ACT II.
1274,"    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
",ACT II.
1275,"    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
",ACT II.
1276,"    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
",ACT II.
1277,"    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
",ACT II.
1278,"    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
",ACT II.
1279,"    Makes vow before his uncle never more
",ACT II.
1280,"    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
",ACT II.
1281,"    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
",ACT II.
1282,"    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
",ACT II.
1283,"    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
",ACT II.
1284,"    So levied as before, against the Polack;
",ACT II.
1285,"    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
",ACT II.

",ACT II.
1290,"    As therein are set down.
",ACT II.
1291,"  King. It likes us well;
",ACT II.
1292,"    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
",ACT II.
1293,"    Answer, and think upon this business.
",ACT II.
1294,"    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
",ACT II.
1295,"    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
",ACT II.
1296,"    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
",ACT II.
1297,"  Pol. This business is well ended.
",ACT II.
1298,"    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
",ACT II.
1299,"    What majesty should be, what duty is,
",ACT II.
1300,"    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
",ACT II.
1301,"    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
",ACT II.
1302,"    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
",ACT II.
1303,"    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
",ACT II.
1304,"    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
",ACT II.
1305,"    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
",ACT II.
1306,"    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
",ACT II.
1307,"    But let that go.
",ACT II.
1308,"  Queen. More matter, with less art.
",ACT II.
1309,"  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
",ACT II.
1310,"    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
",ACT II.
1311,"    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
",ACT II.
1312,"    But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
",ACT II.
1313,"    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
",ACT II.
1314,"    That we find out the cause of this effect-
",ACT II.
1315,"    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
",ACT II.
1316,"    For this effect defective comes by cause.
",ACT II.
1317,"    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
",ACT II.
1318,"    Perpend.
",ACT II.
1319,"    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
",ACT II.
1320,"    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
",ACT II.
1321,"    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
",ACT II.
1322,"                                             [Reads] the letter.
",ACT II.
1323,"    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
",ACT II.
1324,"      Ophelia,'-
",ACT II.
1325,"
",ACT II.
1326,"    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
",ACT II.
1327,"      phrase.
",ACT II.
1328,"    But you shall hear. Thus:
",ACT II.
1329,"                                                        [Reads.]
",ACT II.
1330,"    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
",ACT II.
1331,"  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
",ACT II.
1332,"  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]  
",ACT II.
1333,"
",ACT II.
1334,"          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
",ACT II.
1335,"            Doubt that the sun doth move;
",ACT II.
1336,"          Doubt truth to be a liar;
",ACT II.
1337,"            But never doubt I love.
",ACT II.
1338,"      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
",ACT II.
1339,"    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
",ACT II.
1340,"    it. Adieu.
",ACT II.
1341,"      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
",ACT II.
1342,"                                                          HAMLET.'
",ACT II.
1343,"
",ACT II.
1344,"    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
",ACT II.
1345,"    And more above, hath his solicitings,
",ACT II.
1346,"    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
",ACT II.
1347,"    All given to mine ear.
",ACT II.
1348,"  King. But how hath she
",ACT II.
1349,"    Receiv'd his love?
",ACT II.
1350,"  Pol. What do you think of me?
",ACT II.
1351,"  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
",ACT II.
1352,"  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,  
",ACT II.
1353,"    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
",ACT II.
1354,"    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
",ACT II.
1355,"    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
",ACT II.
1356,"    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
",ACT II.
1357,"    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
",ACT II.
1358,"    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
",ACT II.
1359,"    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
",ACT II.
1360,"    What might you think? No, I went round to work
",ACT II.
1361,"    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
",ACT II.
1362,"    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
",ACT II.
1363,"    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
",ACT II.
1364,"    That she should lock herself from his resort,
",ACT II.
1365,"    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
",ACT II.
1366,"    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
",ACT II.
1367,"    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
",ACT II.
1368,"    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
",ACT II.
1369,"    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
",ACT II.
1370,"    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
",ACT II.
1371,"    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
",ACT II.
1372,"    And all we mourn for.  
",ACT II.
1373,"  King. Do you think 'tis this?
",ACT II.
1374,"  Queen. it may be, very like.
",ACT II.
1375,"  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
",ACT II.
1376,"    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
",ACT II.
1377,"    When it prov'd otherwise.?
",ACT II.
1378,"  King. Not that I know.
",ACT II.
1379,"  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
",ACT II.
1380,"      be otherwise.
",ACT II.
1381,"    If circumstances lead me, I will find
",ACT II.
1382,"    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
",ACT II.
1383,"    Within the centre.
",ACT II.
1384,"  King. How may we try it further?
",ACT II.
1385,"  Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
",ACT II.
1386,"    Here in the lobby.
",ACT II.
1387,"  Queen. So he does indeed.
",ACT II.
1388,"  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
",ACT II.
1389,"    Be you and I behind an arras then.
",ACT II.
1390,"    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
",ACT II.
1391,"    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
",ACT II.
1392,"    Let me be no assistant for a state,  
",ACT II.
1393,"    But keep a farm and carters.
",ACT II.
1394,"  King. We will try it.
",ACT II.
1395,"
",ACT II.
1396,"                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.
",ACT II.
1397,"
",ACT II.
1398,"  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
",ACT II.
1399,"  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
",ACT II.
1400,"    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
",ACT II.
1401,"                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
",ACT II.
1402,"    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
",ACT II.
1403,"  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
",ACT II.
1404,"  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
",ACT II.
1405,"  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
",ACT II.
1406,"  Pol. Not I, my lord.
",ACT II.
1407,"  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
",ACT II.
1408,"  Pol. Honest, my lord?
",ACT II.
1409,"  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
",ACT II.
1410,"    pick'd out of ten thousand.
",ACT II.
1411,"  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
",ACT II.
1412,"  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
",ACT II.
1413,"    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
",ACT II.
1414,"  Pol. I have, my lord.
",ACT II.
1415,"  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
",ACT II.
1416,"    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
",ACT II.
1417,"  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
",ACT II.
1418,"    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far
",ACT II.
1419,"    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
",ACT II.
1420,"    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you
",ACT II.
1421,"    read, my lord?
",ACT II.
1422,"  Ham. Words, words, words.
",ACT II.
1423,"  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
",ACT II.
1424,"  Ham. Between who?
",ACT II.
1425,"  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
",ACT II.
1426,"  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
",ACT II.
1427,"    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
",ACT II.
1428,"    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
",ACT II.
1429,"    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
",ACT II.
1430,"    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
",ACT II.
1431,"    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
",ACT II.
1432,"    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  
",ACT II.
1433,"  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
",ACT II.
1434,"   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
",ACT II.
1435,"  Ham. Into my grave?
",ACT II.
1436,"  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
",ACT II.
1437,"    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
",ACT II.
1438,"    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
",ACT II.
1439,"    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
",ACT II.
1440,"    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
",ACT II.
1441,"    my leave of you.
",ACT II.
1442,"  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
",ACT II.
1443,"    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
",ACT II.
1444,"    life,
",ACT II.
1445,"
",ACT II.
1446,"                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
",ACT II.
1447,"
",ACT II.
1448,"  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
",ACT II.
1449,"  Ham. These tedious old fools!
",ACT II.
1450,"  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
",ACT II.
1451,"  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
",ACT II.
1452,"                                                Exit [Polonius].  
",ACT II.
1453,"  Guil. My honour'd lord!
",ACT II.
1454,"  Ros. My most dear lord!
",ACT II.
1455,"  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
",ACT II.
1456,"    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
",ACT II.
1457,"  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
",ACT II.
1458,"  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
",ACT II.
1459,"    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
",ACT II.
1460,"  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
",ACT II.
1461,"  Ros. Neither, my lord.
",ACT II.
1462,"  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
",ACT II.
1463,"    favours?
",ACT II.
1464,"  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
",ACT II.
1465,"  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
",ACT II.
1466,"    strumpet. What news ?
",ACT II.
1467,"  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
",ACT II.
1468,"  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
",ACT II.
1469,"    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
",ACT II.
1470,"    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
",ACT II.
1471,"    hither?
",ACT II.
1472,"  Guil. Prison, my lord?  
",ACT II.
1473,"  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
",ACT II.
1474,"  Ros. Then is the world one.
",ACT II.
1475,"  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
",ACT II.
1476,"    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
",ACT II.
1477,"  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
",ACT II.
1478,"  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
",ACT II.
1479,"    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
",ACT II.
1480,"  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
",ACT II.
1481,"    mind.
",ACT II.
1482,"  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
",ACT II.
1483,"    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
",ACT II.
1484,"  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
",ACT II.
1485,"    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
",ACT II.
1486,"  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
",ACT II.
1487,"  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
",ACT II.
1488,"    it is but a shadow's shadow.
",ACT II.
1489,"  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
",ACT II.
1490,"    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
",ACT II.
1491,"    fay, I cannot reason.
",ACT II.
1492,"  Both. We'll wait upon you.  
",ACT II.
1493,"  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
",ACT II.
1494,"    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
",ACT II.
1495,"    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
",ACT II.
1496,"    make you at Elsinore?
",ACT II.
1497,"  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
",ACT II.
1498,"  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
",ACT II.
1499,"    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
",ACT II.
1500,"    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
",ACT II.
1501,"    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.
",ACT II.
1502,"  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
",ACT II.
1503,"  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
",ACT II.
1504,"    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
",ACT II.
1505,"    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen
",ACT II.
1506,"    have sent for you.
",ACT II.
1507,"  Ros. To what end, my lord?
",ACT II.
1508,"  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
",ACT II.
1509,"    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
",ACT II.
1510,"    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
",ACT II.
1511,"    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
",ACT II.
1512,"    me, whether you were sent for or no.  
",ACT II.
1513,"  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
",ACT II.
1514,"  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
",ACT II.
1515,"    not off.
",ACT II.
1516,"  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
",ACT II.
1517,"  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
",ACT II.
1518,"    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
",ACT II.
1519,"    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
",ACT II.
1520,"    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
",ACT II.
1521,"    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
",ACT II.
1522,"    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
",ACT II.
1523,"    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
",ACT II.
1524,"    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
",ACT II.
1525,"    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
",ACT II.
1526,"    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
",ACT II.
1527,"    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
",ACT II.
1528,"    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
",ACT II.
1529,"    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
",ACT II.
1530,"    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman
",ACT II.
1531,"    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
",ACT II.
1532,"  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
",ACT II.
1533,"  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
",ACT II.
1534,"  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
",ACT II.
1535,"    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
",ACT II.
1536,"    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
",ACT II.
1537,"  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
",ACT II.
1538,"    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
",ACT II.
1539,"    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
",ACT II.
1540,"    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
",ACT II.
1541,"    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
",ACT II.
1542,"    freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
",ACT II.
1543,"    they?
",ACT II.
1544,"  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
",ACT II.
1545,"    tragedians of the city.
",ACT II.
1546,"  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
",ACT II.
1547,"    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
",ACT II.
1548,"  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
",ACT II.
1549,"    innovation.
",ACT II.
1550,"  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
",ACT II.
1551,"    city? Are they so follow'd?
",ACT II.
1552,"  Ros. No indeed are they not.  
",ACT II.
1553,"  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
",ACT II.
1554,"  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
",ACT II.
1555,"    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
",ACT II.
1556,"    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
",ACT II.
1557,"    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
",ACT II.
1558,"    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
",ACT II.
1559,"    dare scarce come thither.
",ACT II.
1560,"  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
",ACT II.
1561,"    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
",ACT II.
1562,"    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
",ACT II.
1563,"    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means
",ACT II.
1564,"    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
",ACT II.
1565,"    against their own succession.
",ACT II.
1566,"  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
",ACT II.
1567,"    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
",ACT II.
1568,"    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
",ACT II.
1569,"    went to cuffs in the question.
",ACT II.
1570,"  Ham. Is't possible?
",ACT II.
1571,"  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
",ACT II.
1572,"  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
",ACT II.
1573,"  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
",ACT II.
1574,"  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
",ACT II.
1575,"    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
",ACT II.
1576,"    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
",ACT II.
1577,"    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
",ACT II.
1578,"    philosophy could find it out.
",ACT II.
1579,"
",ACT II.
1580,"                     Flourish for the Players.
",ACT II.
1581,"
",ACT II.
1582,"  Guil. There are the players.
",ACT II.
1583,"  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
",ACT II.
1584,"    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
",ACT II.
1585,"    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
",ACT II.
1586,"    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
",ACT II.
1587,"    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
",ACT II.
1588,"    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
",ACT II.
1589,"  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
",ACT II.
1590,"  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
",ACT II.
1591,"    know a hawk from a handsaw.
",ACT II.
1592,"  
",ACT II.
1593,"                            Enter Polonius.
",ACT II.
1594,"
",ACT II.
1595,"  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
",ACT II.
1596,"  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
",ACT II.
1597,"    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
",ACT II.
1598,"    clouts.
",ACT II.
1599,"  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
",ACT II.
1600,"    man is twice a child.
",ACT II.
1601,"  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
",ACT II.
1602,"   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
",ACT II.
1603,"  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
",ACT II.
1604,"  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
",ACT II.
1605,"    Rome-
",ACT II.
1606,"  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
",ACT II.
1607,"  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
",ACT II.
1608,"  Pol. Upon my honour-
",ACT II.
1609,"  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
",ACT II.
1610,"  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
",ACT II.
1611,"    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
",ACT II.
1612,"    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene  
",ACT II.
1613,"    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
",ACT II.
1614,"    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
",ACT II.
1615,"    the only men.
",ACT II.
1616,"  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
",ACT II.
1617,"  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
",ACT II.
1618,"  Ham. Why,
",ACT II.
1619,"
",ACT II.
1620,"         'One fair daughter, and no more,
",ACT II.
1621,"           The which he loved passing well.'
",ACT II.
1622,"
",ACT II.
1623,"  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
",ACT II.
1624,"  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
",ACT II.
1625,"  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
",ACT II.
1626,"    love passing well.
",ACT II.
1627,"  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
",ACT II.
1628,"  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
",ACT II.
1629,"  Ham. Why,
",ACT II.
1630,"
",ACT II.
1631,"           'As by lot, God wot,'
",ACT II.
1632,"
",ACT II.
1633," and then, you know,
",ACT II.
1634,"  
",ACT II.
1635,"           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'
",ACT II.
1636,"
",ACT II.
1637,"    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
",ACT II.
1638,"    where my abridgment comes.
",ACT II.
1639,"
",ACT II.
1640,"                     Enter four or five Players.
",ACT II.
1641,"
",ACT II.
1642,"    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee
",ACT II.
1643,"    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is
",ACT II.
1644,"    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
",ACT II.
1645,"    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
",ACT II.
1646,"    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
",ACT II.
1647,"    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
",ACT II.
1648,"    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are
",ACT II.
1649,"    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
",ACT II.
1650,"    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
",ACT II.
1651,"    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
",ACT II.
1652,"  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
",ACT II.
1653,"  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
",ACT II.
1654,"    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd  
",ACT II.
1655,"    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I
",ACT II.
1656,"    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
",ACT II.
1657,"    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
",ACT II.
1658,"    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
",ACT II.
1659,"    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
",ACT II.
1660,"    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
",ACT II.
1661,"    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
",ACT II.
1662,"    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't
",ACT II.
1663,"    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
",ACT II.
1664,"    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in
",ACT II.
1665,"    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:
",ACT II.
1666,"
",ACT II.
1667,"         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
",ACT II.
1668,"
",ACT II.
1669,"    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
",ACT II.
1670,"
",ACT II.
1671,"         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
",ACT II.
1672,"         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
",ACT II.
1673,"         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
",ACT II.
1674,"         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd  
",ACT II.
1675,"         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
",ACT II.
1676,"         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
",ACT II.
1677,"         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
",ACT II.
1678,"         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
",ACT II.
1679,"         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
",ACT II.
1680,"         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
",ACT II.
1681,"         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
",ACT II.
1682,"         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
",ACT II.
1683,"         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
",ACT II.
1684,"
",ACT II.
1685,"    So, proceed you.
",ACT II.
1686,"  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
",ACT II.
1687,"     discretion.
",ACT II.
1688,"
",ACT II.
1689,"  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
",ACT II.
1690,"      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
",ACT II.
1691,"      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
",ACT II.
1692,"      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
",ACT II.
1693,"      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
",ACT II.
1694,"      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
",ACT II.
1695,"      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
",ACT II.
1696,"      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
",ACT II.
1697,"      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
",ACT II.
1698,"      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
",ACT II.
1699,"      Which was declining on the milky head
",ACT II.
1700,"      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
",ACT II.
1701,"      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
",ACT II.
1702,"      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
",ACT II.
1703,"      Did nothing.
",ACT II.
1704,"      But, as we often see, against some storm,
",ACT II.
1705,"      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
",ACT II.
1706,"      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
",ACT II.
1707,"      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
",ACT II.
1708,"      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
",ACT II.
1709,"      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
",ACT II.
1710,"      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
",ACT II.
1711,"      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
",ACT II.
1712,"      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
",ACT II.
1713,"      Now falls on Priam.
",ACT II.
1714,"      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,  
",ACT II.
1715,"      In general synod take away her power;
",ACT II.
1716,"      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
",ACT II.
1717,"      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
",ACT II.
1718,"      As low as to the fiends!
",ACT II.
1719,"
",ACT II.
1720,"  Pol. This is too long.
",ACT II.
1721,"  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
",ACT II.
1722,"    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
",ACT II.
1723,"    Hecuba.
",ACT II.
1724,"
",ACT II.
1725,"  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'
",ACT II.
1726,"
",ACT II.
1727,"  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
",ACT II.
1728,"  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
",ACT II.
1729,"
",ACT II.
1730,"  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
",ACT II.
1731,"      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
",ACT II.
1732,"      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
",ACT II.
1733,"      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
",ACT II.
1734,"      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
",ACT II.
1735,"      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
",ACT II.
1736,"      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.

",ACT II.
1741,"      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
",ACT II.
1742,"      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
",ACT II.
1743,"      And passion in the gods.'
",ACT II.
1744,"
",ACT II.
1745,"  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
",ACT II.
1746,"    eyes. Prithee no more!
",ACT II.
1747,"  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
",ACT II.
1748,"    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
",ACT II.
1749,"    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
",ACT II.
1750,"    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
",ACT II.
1751,"    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
",ACT II.
1752,"  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
",ACT II.
1753,"  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
",ACT II.
1754,"    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own  
",ACT II.
1755,"    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in
",ACT II.
1756,"    your bounty. Take them in.
",ACT II.
1757,"  Pol. Come, sirs.
",ACT II.
1758,"  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
",ACT II.
1759,"                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
",ACT II.
1760,"    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
",ACT II.
1761,"    Gonzago'?
",ACT II.
1762,"  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
",ACT II.
1763,"  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
",ACT II.
1764,"    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
",ACT II.
1765,"    insert in't, could you not?
",ACT II.
1766,"  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
",ACT II.
1767,"  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.

",ACT II.
1769,"    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to
",ACT II.
1770,"    Elsinore.
",ACT II.
1771,"  Ros. Good my lord!
",ACT II.
1772,"  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!

1773,"                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
",ACT II.
1774,"    Now I am alone.  
",ACT II.
1775,"    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
",ACT II.
1776,"    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
",ACT II.
1777,"    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
",ACT II.
1778,"    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
",ACT II.
1779,"    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
",ACT II.
1780,"    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
",ACT II.
1781,"    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
",ACT II.
1782,"    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
",ACT II.
1783,"    For Hecuba!
",ACT II.
1784,"    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
",ACT II.
1785,"    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
",ACT II.
1786,"    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
",ACT II.
1787,"    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
",ACT II.
1788,"    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
",ACT II.
1789,"    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
",ACT II.
1790,"    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
",ACT II.
1791,"    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
",ACT II.
1792,"    Yet I,
",ACT II.
1793,"    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
",ACT II.
1794,"    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,  
",ACT II.
1795,"    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
",ACT II.
1796,"    Upon whose property and most dear life
",ACT II.
1797,"    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
",ACT II.
1798,"    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
",ACT II.
1799,"    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
",ACT II.
1800,"    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
",ACT II.
1801,"    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
",ACT II.
1802,"    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be

1808,"    O, vengeance!
",ACT II.
1809,"    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
",ACT II.
1810,"    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
",ACT II.
1811,"    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
",ACT II.
1812,"    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
",ACT II.
1813,"    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
",ACT II.
1814,"    A scullion!  
",ACT II.
1815,"    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
",ACT II.
1816,"    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
",ACT II.
1817,"    Have by the very cunning of the scene
",ACT II.
1818,"    Been struck so to the soul that presently
",ACT II.
1819,"    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
",ACT II.
1820,"    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
",ACT II.
1821,"    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
",ACT II.
1822,"    Play something like the murther of my father
",ACT II.
1823,"    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
",ACT II.
1824,"    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
",ACT II.
1825,"    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
",ACT II.
1826,"    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
",ACT II.
1827,"    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
",ACT II.
1828,"    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
",ACT II.
1829,"    As he is very potent with such spirits,
",ACT II.
1830,"    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
",ACT II.
1831,"    More relative than this. The play's the thing
",ACT II.
1832,"    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

1858,"  Queen. Did you assay him  
",ACT III.
1859,"    To any pastime?
",ACT III.
1860,"  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
",ACT III.
1861,"    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
",ACT III.
1862,"    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
",ACT III.
1863,"    To hear of it. They are here about the court,

1883,"    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,

1886,"    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
",ACT III.
1887,"    That your good beauties be the happy cause
",ACT III.
1888,"    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
",ACT III.
1889,"    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
",ACT III.
1890,"    To both your honours.
",ACT III.
1891,"  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.

",ACT III.
1893,"  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
",ACT III.
1894,"    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
",ACT III.
1895,"    That show of such an exercise may colour
",ACT III.
1896,"    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
",ACT III.
1897,"    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
",ACT III.
1898,"    And pious action we do sugar o'er  
",ACT III.
1899,"    The Devil himself.
",ACT III.
1900,"  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
",ACT III.
1901,"    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
",ACT III.
1902,"    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
",ACT III.
1903,"    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
",ACT III.
1904,"    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
",ACT III.
1905,"    O heavy burthen!
",ACT III.
1906,"  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.

1909,"                           Enter Hamlet.
",ACT III.
1910,"
",ACT III.
1911,"  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
",ACT III.
1912,"    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
",ACT III.
1913,"    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
",ACT III.
1914,"    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
",ACT III.
1915,"    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
",ACT III.
1916,"    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
",ACT III.
1917,"    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
",ACT III.
1918,"    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  
",ACT III.
1919,"    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
",ACT III.
1920,"    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
",ACT III.
1921,"    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
",ACT III.
1922,"    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
",ACT III.
1923,"    Must give us pause. There's the respect
",ACT III.
1924,"    That makes calamity of so long life.
",ACT III.
1925,"    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
",ACT III.
1926,"    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
",ACT III.
1927,"    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
",ACT III.
1928,"    The insolence of office, and the spurns
",ACT III.
1929,"    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
",ACT III.
1930,"    When he himself might his quietus make
",ACT III.
1931,"    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
",ACT III.
1932,"    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
",ACT III.
1933,"    But that the dread of something after death-
",ACT III.
1934,"    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
",ACT III.
1935,"    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
",ACT III.
1936,"    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
",ACT III.
1937,"    Than fly to others that we know not of?
",ACT III.
1938,"    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
",ACT III.
1939,"    And thus the native hue of resolution
",ACT III.
1940,"    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
",ACT III.
1941,"    And enterprises of great pith and moment
",ACT III.
1942,"    With this regard their currents turn awry
",ACT III.
1943,"    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
",ACT III.
1944,"    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
",ACT III.
1945,"    Be all my sins rememb'red.
",ACT III.
1946,"  Oph. Good my lord,
",ACT III.
1947,"    How does your honour for this many a day?
",ACT III.
1948,"  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
",ACT III.
1949,"  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
",ACT III.
1950,"    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
",ACT III.
1951,"    I pray you, now receive them.
",ACT III.
1952,"  Ham. No, not I!
",ACT III.
1953,"    I never gave you aught.
",ACT III.
1954,"  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
",ACT III.
1955,"    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
",ACT III.
1956,"    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
",ACT III.
1957,"    Take these again; for to the noble mind
",ACT III.
1958,"    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.  
",ACT III.
1959,"    There, my lord.
",ACT III.
1960,"  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
",ACT III.
1961,"  Oph. My lord?
",ACT III.
1962,"  Ham. Are you fair?
",ACT III.
1963,"  Oph. What means your lordship?
",ACT III.
1964,"  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
",ACT III.
1965,"    discourse to your beauty.
",ACT III.
1966,"  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
",ACT III.
1967,"  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
",ACT III.
1968,"    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
",ACT III.
1969,"    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
",ACT III.
1970,"    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
",ACT III.
1971,"  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
",ACT III.
1972,"  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
",ACT III.
1973,"    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
",ACT III.
1974,"    not.
",ACT III.
1975,"  Oph. I was the more deceived.
",ACT III.
1976,"  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
",ACT III.
1977,"    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
",ACT III.
1978,"    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.  
",ACT III.
1979,"    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
",ACT III.
1980,"    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
",ACT III.
1981,"    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
",ACT III.
1982,"    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
",ACT III.
1983,"    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
",ACT III.
1984,"    father?
",ACT III.
1985,"  Oph. At home, my lord.
",ACT III.
1986,"  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
",ACT III.
1987,"    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
",ACT III.
1988,"  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
",ACT III.
1989,"  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
",ACT III.
1990,"    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
",ACT III.
1991,"    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
",ACT III.
1992,"    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
",ACT III.
1993,"    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
",ACT III.
1994,"    Farewell.
",ACT III.
1995,"  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
",ACT III.
1996,"  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
",ACT III.
1997,"    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
",ACT III.
1998,"    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your  
",ACT III.
1999,"    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
",ACT III.
2000,"    me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
",ACT III.
2001,"    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
",ACT III.
2002,"    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
",ACT III.
2003,"  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
",ACT III.
2004,"    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
",ACT III.
2005,"    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
",ACT III.
2006,"    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
",ACT III.
2007,"    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
",ACT III.
2008,"    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
",ACT III.
2009,"    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
",ACT III.
2010,"    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
",ACT III.
2011,"    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
",ACT III.
2012,"    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
",ACT III.
2013,"    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
",ACT III.
2014,"    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

2016,"                   Enter King and Polonius.
",ACT III.
2017,"
",ACT III.
2018,"  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;  
",ACT III.
2019,"    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
",ACT III.
2020,"    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
",ACT III.
2021,"    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
",ACT III.
2022,"    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
",ACT III.
2023,"    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
",ACT III.
2024,"    I have in quick determination
",ACT III.
2025,"    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
",ACT III.
2026,"    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
",ACT III.
2027,"    Haply the seas, and countries different,
",ACT III.
2028,"    With variable objects, shall expel
",ACT III.
2029,"    This something-settled matter in his heart,
",ACT III.
2030,"    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
",ACT III.
2031,"    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
",ACT III.
2032,"  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
",ACT III.
2033,"    The origin and commencement of his grief
",ACT III.
2034,"    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
",ACT III.
2035,"    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
",ACT III.
2036,"    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
",ACT III.
2037,"    But if you hold it fit, after the play
",ACT III.
2038,"    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him  
",ACT III.
2039,"    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
",ACT III.
2040,"    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
",ACT III.
2041,"    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
",ACT III.
2042,"    To England send him; or confine him where
",ACT III.
2043,"    Your wisdom best shall think.
",ACT III.
2044,"  King. It shall be so.

2054,"
",ACT III.
2055,"  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
",ACT III.
2056,"    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
",ACT III.
2057,"    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
",ACT III.
2058,"    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
",ACT III.
2059,"    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
",ACT III.
2060,"    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
",ACT III.
2061,"    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
",ACT III.
2062,"    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
",ACT III.
2063,"    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
",ACT III.
2064,"    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
",ACT III.
2065,"    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
",ACT III.
2066,"    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
",ACT III.
2067,"  Player. I warrant your honour.
",ACT III.
2068,"  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
",ACT III.
2069,"    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
",ACT III.
2070,"    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
",ACT III.
2071,"    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,  
",ACT III.
2072,"    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
",ACT III.
2073,"    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
",ACT III.
2074,"    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
",ACT III.

",ACT III.
2076,"    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
",ACT III.
2077,"    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
",ACT III.
2078,"    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
",ACT III.
2079,"    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
",ACT III.
2080,"    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
",ACT III.
2081,"    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
",ACT III.
2082,"    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
",ACT III.
2083,"    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
",ACT III.
2084,"    humanity so abominably.
",ACT III.
2085,"  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
",ACT III.
2086,"  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
",ACT III.
2087,"    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
",ACT III.
2088,"    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
",ACT III.
2089,"    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
",ACT III.
2090,"    question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous
",ACT III.
2091,"    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go

",ACT III.
2110,"  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
",ACT III.
2111,"    For what advancement may I hope from thee,  
",ACT III.
2112,"    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits

2113,"    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
",ACT III.

2115,"    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
",ACT III.
2116,"    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
",ACT III.
2117,"    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
",ACT III.
2118,"    And could of men distinguish, her election
",ACT III.
2119,"    Hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been
",ACT III.
2120,"    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
",ACT III.
2121,"    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
",ACT III.
2122,"    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
",ACT III.
2123,"    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
",ACT III.
2124,"    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
",ACT III.
2125,"    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
",ACT III.
2126,"    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
",ACT III.
2127,"    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
",ACT III.
2128,"    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
",ACT III.
2129,"    There is a play to-night before the King.
",ACT III.
2130,"    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
",ACT III.
2131,"    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.  
",ACT III.
2132,"    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
",ACT III.
2133,"    Even with the very comment of thy soul
",ACT III.
2134,"    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
",ACT III.
2135,"    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
",ACT III.
2136,"    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
",ACT III.
2137,"    And my imaginations are as foul
",ACT III.
2138,"    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
",ACT III.
2139,"    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
",ACT III.

",ACT III.
2141,"    In censure of his seeming.
",ACT III.
2142,"  Hor. Well, my lord.
",ACT III.
2143,"    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,

2151,"  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.  
",ACT III.
2152,"    Get you a place.
",ACT III.
2153,"  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
",ACT III.
2154,"  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
",ACT III.
2155,"    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
",ACT III.
2156,"  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
",ACT III.
2157,"    mine.
",ACT III.
2158,"  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
",ACT III.
2159,"    i' th' university, you say?
",ACT III.
2160,"  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
",ACT III.
2161,"  Ham. What did you enact?
",ACT III.
2162,"  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
",ACT III.
2163,"    kill'd me.
",ACT III.
2164,"  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
",ACT III.
2165,"    the players ready.
",ACT III.
2166,"  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
",ACT III.
2167,"  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
",ACT III.
2168,"  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
",ACT III.
2169,"  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
",ACT III.
2170,"  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
",ACT III.
2171,"                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]  
",ACT III.
2172,"  Oph. No, my lord.
",ACT III.
2173,"  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
",ACT III.
2174,"  Oph. Ay, my lord.
",ACT III.
2175,"  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
",ACT III.
2176,"  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
",ACT III.
2177,"  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
",ACT III.
2178,"  Oph. What is, my lord?
",ACT III.
2179,"  Ham. Nothing.
",ACT III.
2180,"  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
",ACT III.
2181,"  Ham. Who, I?
",ACT III.
2182,"  Oph. Ay, my lord.
",ACT III.
2183,"  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
",ACT III.
2184,"    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
",ACT III.
2185,"    within 's two hours.
",ACT III.
2186,"  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
",ACT III.
2187,"  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
",ACT III.
2188,"    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
",ACT III.
2189,"    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
",ACT III.
2190,"    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else
",ACT III.
2191,"    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose  
",ACT III.
2192,"    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'
",ACT III.
2193,"
",ACT III.
2194,"               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.
",ACT III.
2195,"
",ACT III.
2196,"    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
",ACT III.
2197,"    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
",ACT III.
2198,"    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
",ACT III.
2199,"    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
",ACT III.
2200,"    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
",ACT III.
2201,"    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
",ACT III.
2202,"    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
",ACT III.
2203,"    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes,
",ACT III.
2204,"    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
",ACT III.
2205,"    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
",ACT III.
2206,"    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
",ACT III.
2207,"    his love.
",ACT III.
2208,"                                                         Exeunt.
",ACT III.
2209,"
",ACT III.
2210,"  Oph. What means this, my lord?
",ACT III.
2211,"  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.  
",ACT III.
2212,"  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
",ACT III.
2213,"
",ACT III.
2214,"                      Enter Prologue.
",ACT III.
2215,"
",ACT III.
2216,"  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
",ACT III.
2217,"    they'll tell all.
",ACT III.
2218,"  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
",ACT III.
2219,"  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
",ACT III.
2220,"    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
",ACT III.
2221,"  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
",ACT III.
2222,"
",ACT III.
2223,"    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
",ACT III.
2224,"      Here stooping to your clemency,
",ACT III.
2225,"      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]
",ACT III.
2226,"
",ACT III.
2227,"  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
",ACT III.
2228,"  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
",ACT III.
2229,"  Ham. As woman's love.
",ACT III.
2230,"
",ACT III.
2231,"              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.  
",ACT III.
2232,"
",ACT III.
2233,"    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
",ACT III.
2234,"      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
",ACT III.
2235,"      And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
",ACT III.
2236,"      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
",ACT III.
2237,"      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
",ACT III.
2238,"      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
",ACT III.
2239,"    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
",ACT III.
2240,"      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
",ACT III.
2241,"      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
",ACT III.
2242,"      So far from cheer and from your former state.
",ACT III.
2243,"      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
",ACT III.
2244,"      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
",ACT III.
2245,"      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
",ACT III.
2246,"      In neither aught, or in extremity.
",ACT III.
2247,"      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
",ACT III.
2248,"      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
",ACT III.
2249,"      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
",ACT III.
2250,"      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
",ACT III.
2251,"    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;  
",ACT III.
2252,"      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
",ACT III.
2253,"      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
",ACT III.
2254,"      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
",ACT III.
2255,"      For husband shalt thou-
",ACT III.
2256,"    Queen. O, confound the rest!
",ACT III.
2257,"      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
",ACT III.
2258,"      When second husband let me be accurst!
",ACT III.
2259,"      None wed the second but who killed the first.
",ACT III.
2260,"
",ACT III.
2261,"  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
",ACT III.
2262,"
",ACT III.
2263,"    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
",ACT III.
2264,"      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
",ACT III.
2265,"      A second time I kill my husband dead
",ACT III.
2266,"      When second husband kisses me in bed.
",ACT III.
2267,"    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
",ACT III.
2268,"      But what we do determine oft we break.
",ACT III.
2269,"      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
",ACT III.
2270,"      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
",ACT III.
2271,"      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,  
",ACT III.
2272,"      But fill unshaken when they mellow be.
",ACT III.
2273,"      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
",ACT III.
2274,"      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
",ACT III.
2275,"      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
",ACT III.
2276,"      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
",ACT III.
2277,"      The violence of either grief or joy
",ACT III.
2278,"      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
",ACT III.
2279,"      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
",ACT III.
2280,"      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
",ACT III.
2281,"      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
",ACT III.
2282,"      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
",ACT III.
2283,"      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
",ACT III.
2284,"      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
",ACT III.
2285,"      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
",ACT III.
2286,"      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
",ACT III.
2287,"      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
",ACT III.
2288,"      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
",ACT III.
2289,"      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
",ACT III.
2290,"      Directly seasons him his enemy.
",ACT III.
2291,"      But, orderly to end where I begun,  
",ACT III.
2292,"      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
",ACT III.
2293,"      That our devices still are overthrown;
",ACT III.
2294,"      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
",ACT III.
2295,"      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
",ACT III.
2296,"      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
",ACT III.
2297,"    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
",ACT III.
2298,"      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
",ACT III.
2299,"      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
",ACT III.
2300,"      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
",ACT III.
2301,"      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
",ACT III.
2302,"      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
",ACT III.
2303,"      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
",ACT III.
2304,"      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
",ACT III.
2305,"
",ACT III.
2306,"  Ham. If she should break it now!
",ACT III.
2307,"
",ACT III.
2308,"    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
",ACT III.
2309,"      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
",ACT III.
2310,"      The tedious day with sleep.
",ACT III.
2311,"    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,  
",ACT III.
2312,"                                                    [He] sleeps.
",ACT III.
2313,"      And never come mischance between us twain!
",ACT III.
2314,"Exit.
",ACT III.
2315,"
",ACT III.
2316,"  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
",ACT III.
2317,"  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
",ACT III.
2318,"  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
",ACT III.
2319,"  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
",ACT III.
2320,"  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
",ACT III.
2321,"    world.
",ACT III.
2322,"  King. What do you call the play?
",ACT III.
2323,"  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
",ACT III.
2324,"    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;
",ACT III.
2325,"    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece of
",ACT III.
2326,"    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
",ACT III.
2327,"    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our withers
",ACT III.
2328,"    are unwrung.
",ACT III.
2329,"
",ACT III.
2330,"                         Enter Lucianus.
",ACT III.
2331,"  
",ACT III.
2332,"    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
",ACT III.
2333,"  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
",ACT III.
2334,"  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
",ACT III.
2335,"    the puppets dallying.
",ACT III.
2336,"  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
",ACT III.
2337,"  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
",ACT III.
2338,"  Oph. Still better, and worse.
",ACT III.
2339,"  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
",ACT III.
2340,"    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
",ACT III.
2341,"    bellow for revenge.
",ACT III.
2342,"
",ACT III.
2343,"    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
",ACT III.
2344,"      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
",ACT III.
2345,"      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
",ACT III.
2346,"      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
",ACT III.
2347,"      Thy natural magic and dire property
",ACT III.
2348,"      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
",ACT III.
2349,"                                   Pours the poison in his ears.
",ACT III.
2350,"
",ACT III.
2351,"  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.  
",ACT III.
2352,"    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
",ACT III.
2353,"    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
",ACT III.
2354,"  Oph. The King rises.
",ACT III.
2355,"  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
",ACT III.
2356,"  Queen. How fares my lord?
",ACT III.
2357,"  Pol. Give o'er the play.
",ACT III.
2358,"  King. Give me some light! Away!
",ACT III.
2359,"  All. Lights, lights, lights!
",ACT III.
2360,"                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
",ACT III.
2361,"  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
",ACT III.
2362,"          The hart ungalled play;
",ACT III.
2363,"         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
",ACT III.
2364,"          Thus runs the world away.
",ACT III.
2365,"    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my
",ACT III.
2366,"    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my raz'd
",ACT III.
2367,"    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
",ACT III.
2368,"  Hor. Half a share.
",ACT III.
2369,"  Ham.   A whole one I!
",ACT III.
2370,"         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
",ACT III.
2371,"           This realm dismantled was  
",ACT III.
2372,"         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
",ACT III.
2373,"           A very, very- pajock.
",ACT III.
2374,"  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
",ACT III.
2375,"  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
",ACT III.
2376,"    pound! Didst perceive?
",ACT III.
2377,"  Hor. Very well, my lord.
",ACT III.
2378,"  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
",ACT III.
2379,"  Hor. I did very well note him.
",ACT III.
2380,"  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
",ACT III.
2381,"         For if the King like not the comedy,
",ACT III.
2382,"         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
",ACT III.
2383,"    Come, some music!
",ACT III.
2384,"
",ACT III.
2385,"                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
",ACT III.
2386,"
",ACT III.
2387,"  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
",ACT III.
2388,"  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
",ACT III.
2389,"  Guil. The King, sir-
",ACT III.
2390,"  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
",ACT III.
2391,"  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.  
",ACT III.
2392,"  Ham. With drink, sir?
",ACT III.
2393,"  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
",ACT III.
2394,"  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
",ACT III.
2395,"    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
",ACT III.
2396,"    plunge him into far more choler.
",ACT III.
2397,"  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
",ACT III.
2398,"    not so wildly from my affair.
",ACT III.
2399,"  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
",ACT III.
2400,"  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
",ACT III.
2401,"    hath sent me to you.
",ACT III.
2402,"  Ham. You are welcome.
",ACT III.
2403,"  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
",ACT III.
2404,"    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
",ACT III.
2405,"    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
",ACT III.
2406,"    shall be the end of my business.
",ACT III.
2407,"  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
",ACT III.
2408,"  Guil. What, my lord?
",ACT III.
2409,"  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
",ACT III.
2410,"    answer is I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
",ACT III.
2411,"    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother, you  
",ACT III.
2412,"    say-
",ACT III.
2413,"  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
",ACT III.
2414,"    amazement and admiration.
",ACT III.
2415,"  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
",ACT III.
2416,"    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
",ACT III.
2417,"  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
",ACT III.
2418,"  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
",ACT III.
2419,"    further trade with us?
",ACT III.
2420,"  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
",ACT III.
2421,"  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
",ACT III.
2422,"  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
",ACT III.
2423,"    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to
",ACT III.
2424,"    your friend.
",ACT III.
2425,"  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
",ACT III.
2426,"  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself
",ACT III.
2427,"    for your succession in Denmark?
",ACT III.
2428,"  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
",ACT III.
2429,"    musty.
",ACT III.
2430,"
",ACT III.
2431,"                     Enter the Players with recorders.  
",ACT III.
2432,"
",ACT III.
2433,"    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
",ACT III.
2434,"    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
",ACT III.
2435,"    into a toil?
",ACT III.
2436,"  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
",ACT III.
2437,"  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
",ACT III.
2438,"  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
",ACT III.
2439,"  Ham. I pray you.
",ACT III.
2440,"  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
",ACT III.
2441,"  Ham. I do beseech you.
",ACT III.
2442,"  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
",ACT III.
2443,"  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
",ACT III.
2444,"    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
",ACT III.
2445,"    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
",ACT III.
2446,"  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
",ACT III.
2447,"    have not the skill.
",ACT III.
2448,"  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
",ACT III.
2449,"    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
",ACT III.
2450,"    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
",ACT III.
2451,"    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,  
",ACT III.
2452,"    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
",ACT III.
2453,"    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than a
",ACT III.
2454,"    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
",ACT III.
2455,"    you cannot play upon me.
",ACT III.
2456,"
",ACT III.
2457,"                        Enter Polonius.
",ACT III.
2458,"
",ACT III.
2459,"    God bless you, sir!
",ACT III.
2460,"  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
",ACT III.
2461,"  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
",ACT III.
2462,"  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
",ACT III.
2463,"  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
",ACT III.
2464,"  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
",ACT III.
2465,"  Ham. Or like a whale.
",ACT III.
2466,"  Pol. Very like a whale.
",ACT III.
2467,"  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
",ACT III.
2468,"    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
",ACT III.
2469,"  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
",ACT III.
2470,"  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
",ACT III.
2471,"                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]  
",ACT III.
2472,"    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
",ACT III.
2473,"    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
",ACT III.
2474,"    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
",ACT III.
2475,"    And do such bitter business as the day
",ACT III.
2476,"    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
",ACT III.
2477,"    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
",ACT III.
2478,"    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
",ACT III.
2479,"    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
",ACT III.
2480,"    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
",ACT III.
2481,"    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
",ACT III.
2482,"    How in my words somever she be shent,
",ACT III.
2483,"    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.

2490,"
",ACT III.
2491,"Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
",ACT III.
2492,"
",ACT III.
2493,"  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
",ACT III.
2494,"    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
",ACT III.
2495,"    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
",ACT III.
2496,"    And he to England shall along with you.
",ACT III.
2497,"    The terms of our estate may not endure

",ACT III.
2502,"    To keep those many many bodies safe
",ACT III.
2503,"    That live and feed upon your Majesty.

",ACT III.
2509,"    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw  
",ACT III.
2510,"    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
",ACT III.
2511,"    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
",ACT III.
2512,"    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
",ACT III.
2513,"    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
",ACT III.
2514,"    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
",ACT III.
2515,"    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
",ACT III.
2516,"    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
",ACT III.
2517,"  King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
",ACT III.
2518,"    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
",ACT III.
2519,"    Which now goes too free-footed.
",ACT III.

",ACT III.
2524,"
",ACT III.
2525,"  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
",ACT III.
2526,"    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
",ACT III.
2527,"    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
",ACT III.
2528,"    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
",ACT III.
2529,"    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
",ACT III.
2530,"    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
",ACT III.
2531,"    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
",ACT III.
2532,"    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
",ACT III.
2533,"    And tell you what I know.
",ACT III.
2534,"  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
",ACT III.
2535,"                                                Exit [Polonius].
",ACT III.
2536,"    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
",ACT III.
2537,"    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
",ACT III.
2538,"    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
",ACT III.
2539,"    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
",ACT III.
2540,"    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
",ACT III.
2541,"    And, like a man to double business bound,
",ACT III.
2542,"    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
",ACT III.
2543,"    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
",ACT III.
2544,"    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
",ACT III.
2545,"    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
",ACT III.
2546,"    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
",ACT III.
2547,"    But to confront the visage of offence?
",ACT III.
2548,"    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
",ACT III.
2549,"    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,  
",ACT III.
2550,"    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
",ACT III.
2551,"    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
",ACT III.
2552,"    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
",ACT III.
2553,"    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
",ACT III.
2554,"    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
",ACT III.
2555,"    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
",ACT III.
2556,"    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
",ACT III.
2557,"    In the corrupted currents of this world
",ACT III.
2558,"    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
",ACT III.
2559,"    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
",ACT III.
2560,"    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
",ACT III.
2561,"    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
",ACT III.
2562,"    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
",ACT III.
2563,"    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
",ACT III.
2564,"    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
",ACT III.
2565,"    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
",ACT III.
2566,"    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
",ACT III.
2567,"    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
",ACT III.
2568,"    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
",ACT III.
2569,"    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.  
",ACT III.
2570,"    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
",ACT III.
2571,"    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
",ACT III.
2572,"    All may be well.                                  He kneels.
",ACT III.
2573,"
",ACT III.
2574,"                         Enter Hamlet.
",ACT III.
2575,"
",ACT III.
2576,"  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
",ACT III.
2577,"    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
",ACT III.
2578,"    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
",ACT III.
2579,"    A villain kills my father; and for that,
",ACT III.
2580,"    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
",ACT III.
2581,"    To heaven.
",ACT III.
2582,"    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
",ACT III.
2583,"    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
",ACT III.
2584,"    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
",ACT III.
2585,"    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
",ACT III.
2586,"    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
",ACT III.
2587,"    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
",ACT III.
2588,"    To take him in the purging of his soul,
",ACT III.
2589,"    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?  
",ACT III.
2590,"    No.
",ACT III.
2591,"    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
",ACT III.
2592,"    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
",ACT III.
2593,"    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
",ACT III.
2594,"    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
",ACT III.
2595,"    That has no relish of salvation in't-
",ACT III.
2596,"    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
",ACT III.
2597,"    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
",ACT III.
2598,"    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
",ACT III.
2599,"    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
",ACT III.
2600,"  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
",ACT III.
2601,"    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.

",ACT III.
2613,"    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between

",ACT III.
2615,"    Pray you be round with him.
",ACT III.
2616,"  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
",ACT III.
2617,"  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.

",ACT III.
2623,"  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
",ACT III.
2624,"  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
",ACT III.
2625,"  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
",ACT III.
2626,"  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
",ACT III.
2627,"  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?  
",ACT III.
2628,"  Ham. What's the matter now?
",ACT III.
2629,"  Queen. Have you forgot me?
",ACT III.
2630,"  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
",ACT III.
2631,"    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
",ACT III.
2632,"    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
",ACT III.
2633,"  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
",ACT III.
2634,"  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I
",ACT III.
2635,"    You go not till I set you up a glass
",ACT III.
2636,"    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
",ACT III.
2637,"  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
",ACT III.
2638,"    Help, help, ho!
",ACT III.
2639,"  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
",ACT III.
2640,"  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
",ACT III.

",ACT III.
2643,"  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
",ACT III.
2644,"  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
",ACT III.
2645,"  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
",ACT III.
2646,"  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
",ACT III.
2647,"    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.  
",ACT III.
2648,"  Queen. As kill a king?
",ACT III.
2649,"  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
",ACT III.
2650,"                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
",ACT III.
2651,"    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
",ACT III.
2652,"    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
",ACT III.
2653,"    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
",ACT III.
2654,"    Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down
",ACT III.

2657,"    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
",ACT III.
2658,"    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
",ACT III.
2659,"  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
",ACT III.
2660,"    In noise so rude against me?
",ACT III.
2661,"  Ham. Such an act
",ACT III.
2662,"    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
",ACT III.
2663,"    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
",ACT III.
2664,"    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
",ACT III.
2665,"    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
",ACT III.
2666,"    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
",ACT III.
2667,"    As from the body of contraction plucks  
",ACT III.
2668,"    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
",ACT III.
2669,"    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
",ACT III.
2670,"    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
",ACT III.
2671,"    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
",ACT III.
2672,"    Is thought-sick at the act.
",ACT III.
2673,"  Queen. Ay me, what act,
",ACT III.
2674,"    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
",ACT III.
2675,"  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
",ACT III.
2676,"    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
",ACT III.
2677,"    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
",ACT III.
2678,"    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
",ACT III.
2679,"    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
",ACT III.
2680,"    A station like the herald Mercury
",ACT III.
2681,"    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
",ACT III.
2682,"    A combination and a form indeed
",ACT III.
2683,"    Where every god did seem to set his seal
",ACT III.
2684,"    To give the world assurance of a man.
",ACT III.
2685,"    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
",ACT III.
2686,"    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
",ACT III.
2687,"    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?  
",ACT III.
2688,"    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
",ACT III.
2689,"    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
",ACT III.
2690,"    You cannot call it love; for at your age
",ACT III.
2691,"    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
",ACT III.
2692,"    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
",ACT III.
2693,"    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
",ACT III.
2694,"    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
",ACT III.
2695,"    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
",ACT III.
2696,"    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
",ACT III.
2697,"    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
",ACT III.
2698,"    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
",ACT III.
2699,"    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
",ACT III.
2700,"    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
",ACT III.
2701,"    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
",ACT III.
2702,"    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
",ACT III.
2703,"    Could not so mope.
",ACT III.
2704,"    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
",ACT III.
2705,"    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
",ACT III.
2706,"    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
",ACT III.
2707,"    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame  
",ACT III.
2708,"    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
",ACT III.
2709,"    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
",ACT III.
2710,"    And reason panders will.
",ACT III.
2711,"  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
",ACT III.
2712,"    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
",ACT III.
2713,"    And there I see such black and grained spots
",ACT III.
2714,"    As will not leave their tinct.
",ACT III.
2715,"  Ham. Nay, but to live
",ACT III.
2716,"    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
",ACT III.
2717,"    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
",ACT III.
2718,"    Over the nasty sty!
",ACT III.
2719,"  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
",ACT III.
2720,"    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
",ACT III.
2721,"    No more, sweet Hamlet!
",ACT III.
2722,"  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
",ACT III.
2723,"    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
",ACT III.
2724,"    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
",ACT III.
2725,"    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
",ACT III.
2726,"    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
",ACT III.
2727,"    And put it in his pocket!  
",ACT III.
2728,"  Queen. No more!
",ACT III.
2729,"
",ACT III.
2730,"                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.
",ACT III.
2731,"
",ACT III.
2732,"  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
",ACT III.
2733,"    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
",ACT III.
2734,"    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
",ACT III.
2735,"  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
",ACT III.
2736,"  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
",ACT III.
2737,"    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
",ACT III.
2738,"    Th' important acting of your dread command?
",ACT III.
2739,"    O, say!
",ACT III.
2740,"  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
",ACT III.
2741,"    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
",ACT III.
2742,"    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
",ACT III.
2743,"    O, step between her and her fighting soul
",ACT III.
2744,"    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
",ACT III.
2745,"    Speak to her, Hamlet.
",ACT III.
2746,"  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
",ACT III.
2747,"  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,  
",ACT III.
2748,"    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
",ACT III.
2749,"    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
",ACT III.
2750,"    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
",ACT III.
2751,"    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
",ACT III.
2752,"    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
",ACT III.
2753,"    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
",ACT III.
2754,"    Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
",ACT III.
2755,"    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
",ACT III.
2756,"  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
",ACT III.
2757,"    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
",ACT III.
2758,"    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
",ACT III.
2759,"    Lest with this piteous action you convert
",ACT III.
2760,"    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
",ACT III.

",ACT III.
2762,"  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
",ACT III.
2763,"  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
",ACT III.
2764,"  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
",ACT III.
2765,"  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
",ACT III.
2766,"  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
",ACT III.
2767,"  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!  
",ACT III.
2768,"    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
",ACT III.
2769,"    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
",ACT III.
2770,"                                                     Exit Ghost.
",ACT III.
2771,"  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
",ACT III.
2772,"    This bodiless creation ecstasy
",ACT III.
2773,"    Is very cunning in.
",ACT III.
2774,"  Ham. Ecstasy?
",ACT III.
2775,"    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
",ACT III.
2776,"    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
",ACT III.
2777,"    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
",ACT III.
2778,"    And I the matter will reword; which madness
",ACT III.
2779,"    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
",ACT III.
2780,"    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
",ACT III.
2781,"    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
",ACT III.
2782,"    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
",ACT III.
2783,"    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
",ACT III.
2784,"    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
",ACT III.
2785,"    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
",ACT III.
2786,"    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
",ACT III.
2787,"    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;  
",ACT III.
2788,"    For in the fatness of these pursy times
",ACT III.
2789,"    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
",ACT III.
2790,"    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
",ACT III.
2791,"  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
",ACT III.
2792,"  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
",ACT III.
2793,"    And live the purer with the other half,
",ACT III.
2794,"    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
",ACT III.
2795,"    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
",ACT III.
2796,"    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
",ACT III.
2797,"    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
",ACT III.
2798,"    That to the use of actions fair and good
",ACT III.
2799,"    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
",ACT III.
2800,"    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
",ACT III.
2801,"    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
",ACT III.
2802,"    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
",ACT III.
2803,"    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
",ACT III.
2804,"    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
",ACT III.
2805,"    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
",ACT III.
2806,"    And when you are desirous to be blest,
",ACT III.
2807,"    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,  
",ACT III.
2808,"    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
",ACT III.
2809,"    To punish me with this, and this with me,
",ACT III.
2810,"    That I must be their scourge and minister.
",ACT III.
2811,"    I will bestow him, and will answer well
",ACT III.
2812,"    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
",ACT III.
2813,"    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
",ACT III.
2814,"    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
",ACT III.
2815,"    One word more, good lady.
",ACT III.
2816,"  Queen. What shall I do?
",ACT III.
2817,"  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
",ACT III.
2818,"    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
",ACT III.
2819,"    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
",ACT III.
2820,"    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
",ACT III.
2821,"    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
",ACT III.
2822,"    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
",ACT III.
2823,"    That I essentially am not in madness,
",ACT III.
2824,"    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
",ACT III.
2825,"    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
",ACT III.
2826,"    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
",ACT III.
2827,"    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?  
",ACT III.
2828,"    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
",ACT III.
2829,"    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
",ACT III.
2830,"    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
",ACT III.
2831,"    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
",ACT III.
2832,"    And break your own neck down.
",ACT III.
2833,"  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
",ACT III.
2834,"    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
",ACT III.
2835,"    What thou hast said to me.
",ACT III.
2836,"  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
",ACT III.
2837,"  Queen. Alack,
",ACT III.
2838,"    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
",ACT III.
2839,"  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
",ACT III.
2840,"    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
",ACT III.
2841,"    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
",ACT III.
2842,"    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
",ACT III.
2843,"    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
",ACT III.
2844,"    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
",ACT III.
2845,"    But I will delve one yard below their mines
",ACT III.
2846,"    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
",ACT III.
2847,"    When in one line two crafts directly meet.  
",ACT III.
2848,"    This man shall set me packing.
",ACT III.
2849,"    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
",ACT III.
2850,"    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
",ACT III.
2851,"    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
",ACT III.
2852,"    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
",ACT III.
2853,"    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
",ACT III.

",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.
2880,"  King. O heavy deed!
",ACT IV.
2881,"    It had been so with us, had we been there.
",ACT IV.
2882,"    His liberty is full of threats to all-
",ACT IV.
2883,"    To you yourself, to us, to every one.  
",ACT IV.
2884,"    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
",ACT IV.

2942,"    of a king?
",ACT IV.
2943,"  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
",ACT IV.
2944,"  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,

",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.
2993,"  Ham. At supper.
",ACT IV.
2994,"  King. At supper? Where?
",ACT IV.
2995,"  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
",ACT IV.
2996,"    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
",ACT IV.
2997,"    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and
",ACT IV.
2998,"    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar
",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.
3003,"    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
",ACT IV.
3004,"  King. What dost thou mean by this?  
",ACT IV.
3005,"  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
",ACT IV.
3006,"    the guts of a beggar.
",ACT IV.
3007,"  King. Where is Polonius?
",ACT IV.
3008,"  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
",ACT IV.
3009,"    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you
",ACT IV.
3010,"    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up

3069,"       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.
",ACT IV.
3070,"
",ACT IV.
3071,"  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
",ACT IV.
3072,"  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
",ACT IV.
3073,"  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
",ACT IV.
3074,"  Capt. Against some part of Poland.  
",ACT IV.
3075,"  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
",ACT IV.
3076,"  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
",ACT IV.
3077,"  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
",ACT IV.
3078,"    Or for some frontier?
",ACT IV.
3079,"  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
",ACT IV.
3080,"    We go to gain a little patch of ground
",ACT IV.
3081,"    That hath in it no profit but the name.
",ACT IV.
3082,"    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
",ACT IV.
3083,"    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
",ACT IV.
3084,"    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
",ACT IV.
3085,"  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
",ACT IV.
3086,"  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
",ACT IV.
3087,"  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
",ACT IV.
3088,"    Will not debate the question of this straw.
",ACT IV.
3089,"    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
",ACT IV.
3090,"    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
",ACT IV.
3091,"    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
",ACT IV.
3092,"  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
",ACT IV.
3093,"  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
",ACT IV.
3094,"  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.  
",ACT IV.
3095,"                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
",ACT IV.
3096,"    How all occasions do inform against me
",ACT IV.
3097,"    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
",ACT IV.
3098,"    If his chief good and market of his time
",ACT IV.
3099,"    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
",ACT IV.
3100,"    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
",ACT IV.
3101,"    Looking before and after, gave us not
",ACT IV.
3102,"    That capability and godlike reason
",ACT IV.
3103,"    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
",ACT IV.
3104,"    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
",ACT IV.
3105,"    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
",ACT IV.
3106,"    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
",ACT IV.
3107,"    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
",ACT IV.
3108,"    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
",ACT IV.
3109,"    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
",ACT IV.
3110,"    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
",ACT IV.
3111,"    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
",ACT IV.
3112,"    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
",ACT IV.
3113,"    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
",ACT IV.
3114,"    Makes mouths at the invisible event,  
",ACT IV.
3115,"    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
",ACT IV.
3116,"    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
",ACT IV.
3117,"    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
",ACT IV.
3118,"    Is not to stir without great argument,
",ACT IV.
3119,"    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
",ACT IV.
3120,"    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
",ACT IV.
3121,"    That have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
",ACT IV.
3122,"    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
",ACT IV.
3123,"    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
",ACT IV.
3124,"    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
",ACT IV.
3125,"    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
",ACT IV.
3126,"    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
",ACT IV.
3127,"    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
",ACT IV.
3128,"    Which is not tomb enough and continent
",ACT IV.
3129,"    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
",ACT IV.
3130,"    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

",ACT IV.
3142,"  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
",ACT IV.
3143,"    Her mood will needs be pitied.
",ACT IV.
3144,"  Queen. What would she have?
",ACT IV.
3145,"  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
",ACT IV.
3146,"    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
",ACT IV.
3147,"    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
",ACT IV.
3148,"    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
",ACT IV.
3149,"    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
",ACT IV.
3150,"    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
",ACT IV.
3151,"    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
",ACT IV.
3152,"    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
",ACT IV.
3153,"    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
",ACT IV.
3154,"    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
",ACT IV.
3155,"  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
",ACT IV.
3156,"    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
",ACT IV.
3157,"  Queen. Let her come in.  
",ACT IV.

3197,"  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.  
",ACT IV.
3198,"    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
",ACT IV.
3199,"    your table!
",ACT IV.
3200,"  King. Conceit upon her father.
",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.
3238,"    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
",ACT IV.
3239,"    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
",ACT IV.
3240,"    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
",ACT IV.
3241,"    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
",ACT IV.
3242,"    Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author
",ACT IV.
3243,"    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
",ACT IV.
3244,"    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
",ACT IV.
3245,"    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
",ACT IV.
3246,"    In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia
",ACT IV.
3247,"    Divided from herself and her fair-judgment,
",ACT IV.
3248,"    Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts;
",ACT IV.
3249,"    Last, and as such containing as all these,
",ACT IV.
3250,"    Her brother is in secret come from France;
",ACT IV.
3251,"    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
",ACT IV.
3252,"    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
",ACT IV.
3253,"    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
",ACT IV.
3254,"    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
",ACT IV.
3255,"    Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
",ACT IV.
3256,"    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
",ACT IV.
3257,"    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places  
",ACT IV.
3258,"    Give, me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
",ACT IV.
3259,"  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
",ACT IV.
3260,"  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
",ACT IV.
3261,"
",ACT IV.
3262,"                     Enter a Messenger.
",ACT IV.
3263,"
",ACT IV.
3264,"    What is the matter?
",ACT IV.
3265,"  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
",ACT IV.
3266,"    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
",ACT IV.
3267,"    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
",ACT IV.
3268,"    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
",ACT IV.
3269,"    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
",ACT IV.
3270,"    And, as the world were now but to begin,
",ACT IV.
3271,"    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
",ACT IV.
3272,"    The ratifiers and props of every word,
",ACT IV.
3273,"    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
",ACT IV.
3274,"    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
",ACT IV.
3275,"    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
",ACT IV.
3276,"                                                 A noise within.
",ACT IV.
3277,"  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!  
",ACT IV.
3278,"    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
",ACT IV.
3279,"  King. The doors are broke.
",ACT IV.
3280,"
",ACT IV.
3281,"                    Enter Laertes with others.
",ACT IV.
3282,"
",ACT IV.
3283,"  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
",ACT IV.
3284,"  All. No, let's come in!
",ACT IV.
3285,"  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
",ACT IV.
3286,"  All. We will, we will!
",ACT IV.
3287,"  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
",ACT IV.
3288,"    O thou vile king,
",ACT IV.
3289,"    Give me my father!
",ACT IV.
3290,"  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
",ACT IV.
3291,"  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
",ACT IV.
3292,"    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
",ACT IV.
3293,"    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
",ACT IV.
3294,"    Of my true mother.
",ACT IV.
3295,"  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
",ACT IV.
3296,"    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
",ACT IV.
3297,"    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.  
",ACT IV.
3298,"    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
",ACT IV.
3299,"    That treason can but peep to what it would,
",ACT IV.
3300,"    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
",ACT IV.
3301,"    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
",ACT IV.
3302,"    Speak, man.
",ACT IV.
3303,"  Laer. Where is my father?
",ACT IV.
3304,"  King. Dead.
",ACT IV.
3305,"  Queen. But not by him!
",ACT IV.
3306,"  King. Let him demand his fill.
",ACT IV.
3307,"  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
",ACT IV.
3308,"    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
",ACT IV.
3309,"    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
",ACT IV.
3310,"    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
",ACT IV.
3311,"    That both the world, I give to negligence,
",ACT IV.
3312,"    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
",ACT IV.
3313,"    Most throughly for my father.
",ACT IV.
3314,"  King. Who shall stay you?
",ACT IV.
3315,"  Laer. My will, not all the world!
",ACT IV.
3316,"    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
",ACT IV.
3317,"    They shall go far with little.  
",ACT IV.
3318,"  King. Good Laertes,
",ACT IV.
3319,"    If you desire to know the certainty
",ACT IV.
3320,"    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in Your revenge
",ACT IV.
3321,"    That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
",ACT IV.
3322,"    Winner and loser?
",ACT IV.
3323,"  Laer. None but his enemies.
",ACT IV.
3324,"  King. Will you know them then?
",ACT IV.
3325,"  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
",ACT IV.
3326,"    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
",ACT IV.
3327,"    Repast them with my blood.
",ACT IV.
3328,"  King. Why, now You speak
",ACT IV.
3329,"    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
",ACT IV.
3330,"    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
",ACT IV.
3331,"    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
",ACT IV.
3332,"    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
",ACT IV.
3333,"    As day does to your eye.
",ACT IV.
3334,"                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
",ACT IV.
3335,"  Laer. How now? What noise is that?
",ACT IV.
3336,"
",ACT IV.
3337,"                      Enter Ophelia.  
",ACT IV.
3338,"
",ACT IV.
3339,"    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
",ACT IV.
3340,"    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
",ACT IV.
3341,"    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
",ACT IV.
3342,"    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
",ACT IV.
3343,"    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
",ACT IV.
3344,"    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
",ACT IV.
3345,"    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
",ACT IV.
3346,"    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
",ACT IV.
3347,"    It sends some precious instance of itself
",ACT IV.
3348,"    After the thing it loves.
",ACT IV.
3349,"
",ACT IV.
3350,"  Oph. (sings)
",ACT IV.
3351,"         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
",ACT IV.
3352,"           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
",ACT IV.
3353,"         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.
",ACT IV.
3354,"
",ACT IV.
3355,"    Fare you well, my dove!
",ACT IV.
3356,"  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
",ACT IV.
3357,"    It could not move thus.  
",ACT IV.
3358,"  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
",ACT IV.
3359,"    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
",ACT IV.
3360,"    master's daughter.
",ACT IV.
3361,"  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
",ACT IV.
3362,"  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
",ACT IV.
3363,"    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
",ACT IV.
3364,"  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
",ACT IV.
3365,"  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
",ACT IV.
3366,"    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.
",ACT IV.
3367,"    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
",ACT IV.
3368,"    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father

",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.
3378,"           No, no, he is dead;  
",ACT IV.

3380,"         He never will come again.
",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.
3384,"           He is gone, he is gone,

",ACT IV.
3389,"Exit.
",ACT IV.
3390,"  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
",ACT IV.
3391,"  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
",ACT IV.
3392,"    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
",ACT IV.
3393,"    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
",ACT IV.
3394,"    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
",ACT IV.
3395,"    If by direct or by collateral hand
",ACT IV.
3396,"    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
",ACT IV.
3397,"    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
",ACT IV.
3398,"    To you in satisfaction; but if not,  
",ACT IV.
3399,"    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
",ACT IV.
3400,"    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
",ACT IV.
3401,"    To give it due content.
",ACT IV.
3402,"  Laer. Let this be so.
",ACT IV.
3403,"    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
",ACT IV.
3404,"    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
",ACT IV.
3405,"    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
",ACT IV.
3406,"    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
",ACT IV.
3407,"    That I must call't in question.
",ACT IV.
3408,"  King. So you shall;
",ACT IV.
3409,"    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
",ACT IV.
3410,"    I pray you go with me.

",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.
3443,"    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for
",ACT IV.
3444,"    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou
",ACT IV.
3445,"    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.
3467,"    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
",ACT IV.
3468,"    That he which hath your noble father slain
",ACT IV.
3469,"    Pursued my life.
",ACT IV.
3470,"  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
",ACT IV.
3471,"    Why you proceeded not against these feats
",ACT IV.
3472,"    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
",ACT IV.
3473,"    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
",ACT IV.
3474,"    You mainly were stirr'd up.
",ACT IV.
3475,"  King. O, for two special reasons,
",ACT IV.
3476,"    Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
",ACT IV.
3477,"    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
",ACT IV.
3478,"    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
",ACT IV.
3479,"    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
",ACT IV.
3480,"    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
",ACT IV.
3481,"    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,  
",ACT IV.
3482,"    I could not but by her. The other motive
",ACT IV.
3483,"    Why to a public count I might not go
",ACT IV.
3484,"    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
",ACT IV.
3485,"    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
",ACT IV.
3486,"    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
",ACT IV.
3487,"    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
",ACT IV.
3488,"    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
",ACT IV.
3489,"    Would have reverted to my bow again,
",ACT IV.
3490,"    And not where I had aim'd them.
",ACT IV.
3491,"  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
",ACT IV.
3492,"    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
",ACT IV.
3493,"    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
",ACT IV.
3494,"    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
",ACT IV.
3495,"    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
",ACT IV.
3496,"  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
",ACT IV.
3497,"    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
",ACT IV.
3498,"    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
",ACT IV.
3499,"    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
",ACT IV.
3500,"    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
",ACT IV.
3501,"    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-  
",ACT IV.
3502,"
",ACT IV.
3503,"                 Enter a Messenger with letters.
",ACT IV.
3504,"
",ACT IV.
3505,"    How now? What news?
",ACT IV.
3506,"  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
",ACT IV.
3507,"    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
",ACT IV.
3508,"  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
",ACT IV.
3509,"  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
",ACT IV.
3510,"    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
",ACT IV.
3511,"    Of him that brought them.
",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.
3515,"    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on your
",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.

",ACT IV.
3518,"    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
",ACT IV.
3519,"                                                     'HAMLET.'
",ACT IV.
3520,"    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
",ACT IV.
3521,"    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?  
",ACT IV.
3522,"  Laer. Know you the hand?
",ACT IV.
3523,"  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
",ACT IV.
3524,"    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
",ACT IV.
3525,"    Can you advise me?
",ACT IV.
3526,"  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
",ACT IV.
3527,"    It warms the very sickness in my heart
",ACT IV.
3528,"    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
",ACT IV.
3529,"    'Thus didest thou.'
",ACT IV.
3530,"  King. If it be so, Laertes
",ACT IV.
3531,"    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
",ACT IV.
3532,"    Will you be rul'd by me?
",ACT IV.
3533,"  Laer. Ay my lord,
",ACT IV.
3534,"    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
",ACT IV.
3535,"  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
",ACT IV.
3536,"    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
",ACT IV.
3537,"    No more to undertake it, I will work him
",ACT IV.
3538,"    To exploit now ripe in my device,
",ACT IV.
3539,"    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
",ACT IV.
3540,"    And for his death no wind
",ACT IV.
3541,"    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
",ACT IV.
3542,"    And call it accident.
",ACT IV.
3543,"  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
",ACT IV.
3544,"    The rather, if you could devise it so
",ACT IV.
3545,"    That I might be the organ.
",ACT IV.
3546,"  King. It falls right.
",ACT IV.
3547,"    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
",ACT IV.
3548,"    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
",ACT IV.
3549,"    Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts
",ACT IV.
3550,"    Did not together pluck such envy from him
",ACT IV.
3551,"    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
",ACT IV.
3552,"    Of the unworthiest siege.
",ACT IV.
3553,"  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
",ACT IV.
3554,"  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
",ACT IV.
3555,"    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
",ACT IV.
3556,"    The light and careless livery that it wears
",ACT IV.
3557,"    Thin settled age his sables and his weeds,
",ACT IV.
3558,"    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
",ACT IV.
3559,"    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
",ACT IV.
3560,"    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
",ACT IV.
3561,"    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  
",ACT IV.
3562,"    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
",ACT IV.
3563,"    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
",ACT IV.
3564,"    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
",ACT IV.
3565,"    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
",ACT IV.
3566,"    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
",ACT IV.
3567,"    Come short of what he did.
",ACT IV.
3568,"  Laer. A Norman was't?
",ACT IV.
3569,"  King. A Norman.
",ACT IV.
3570,"  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
",ACT IV.
3571,"  King. The very same.
",ACT IV.
3572,"  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
",ACT IV.
3573,"    And gem of all the nation.
",ACT IV.
3574,"  King. He made confession of you;
",ACT IV.
3575,"    And gave you such a masterly report
",ACT IV.
3576,"    For art and exercise in your defence,
",ACT IV.
3577,"    And for your rapier most especially,
",ACT IV.
3578,"    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
",ACT IV.
3579,"    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
",ACT IV.
3580,"    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
",ACT IV.
3581,"    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his  
",ACT IV.
3582,"    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
",ACT IV.
3583,"    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
",ACT IV.
3584,"    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
",ACT IV.
3585,"    Now, out of this-
",ACT IV.
3586,"  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
",ACT IV.
3587,"  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
",ACT IV.
3588,"    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
",ACT IV.
3589,"    A face without a heart,'
",ACT IV.
3590,"  Laer. Why ask you this?
",ACT IV.
3591,"  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
",ACT IV.
3592,"    But that I know love is begun by time,
",ACT IV.
3593,"    And that I see, in passages of proof,
",ACT IV.
3594,"    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
",ACT IV.
3595,"    There lives within the very flame of love
",ACT IV.
3596,"    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
",ACT IV.
3597,"    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
",ACT IV.
3598,"    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
",ACT IV.
3599,"    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
",ACT IV.
3600,"    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
",ACT IV.
3601,"    And hath abatements and delays as many  
",ACT IV.
3602,"    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
",ACT IV.
3603,"    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
",ACT IV.
3604,"    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
",ACT IV.
3605,"    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
",ACT IV.
3606,"    To show yourself your father's son in deed
",ACT IV.
3607,"    More than in words?
",ACT IV.
3608,"  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
",ACT IV.
3609,"  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
",ACT IV.
3610,"    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
",ACT IV.
3611,"    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
",ACT IV.
3612,"    Will return'd shall know you are come home.
",ACT IV.
3613,"    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
",ACT IV.
3614,"    And set a double varnish on the fame
",ACT IV.
3615,"    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
",ACT IV.
3616,"    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
",ACT IV.
3617,"    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
",ACT IV.
3618,"    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
",ACT IV.
3619,"    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
",ACT IV.
3620,"    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
",ACT IV.
3621,"    Requite him for your father.  
",ACT IV.
3622,"  Laer. I will do't!
",ACT IV.
3623,"    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
",ACT IV.
3624,"    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
",ACT IV.
3625,"    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
",ACT IV.
3626,"    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
",ACT IV.
3627,"    Collected from all simples that have virtue
",ACT IV.
3628,"    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
",ACT IV.
3629,"    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
",ACT IV.
3630,"    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
",ACT IV.
3631,"    It may be death.
",ACT IV.
3632,"  King. Let's further think of this,
",ACT IV.
3633,"    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
",ACT IV.
3634,"    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
",ACT IV.
3635,"    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
",ACT IV.
3636,"    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
",ACT IV.
3637,"    Should have a back or second, that might hold
",ACT IV.
3638,"    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
",ACT IV.
3639,"    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
",ACT IV.
3640,"    I ha't!
",ACT IV.
3641,"    When in your motion you are hot and dry-  
",ACT IV.
3642,"    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
",ACT IV.
3643,"    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
",ACT IV.
3644,"    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
",ACT IV.
3645,"    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
",ACT IV.
3646,"    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,
",ACT IV.
3647,"
",ACT IV.
3648,"                           Enter Queen.
",ACT IV.
3649,"
",ACT IV.
3650,"    How now, sweet queen?
",ACT IV.
3651,"  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
",ACT IV.
3652,"    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
",ACT IV.
3653,"  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
",ACT IV.
3654,"  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
",ACT IV.
3655,"    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
",ACT IV.
3656,"    There with fantastic garlands did she come
",ACT IV.
3657,"    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
",ACT IV.
3658,"    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
",ACT IV.
3659,"    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
",ACT IV.
3660,"    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
",ACT IV.
3661,"    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,  
",ACT IV.
3662,"    When down her weedy trophies and herself
",ACT IV.
3663,"    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
",ACT IV.
3664,"    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
",ACT IV.
3665,"    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
",ACT IV.
3666,"    As one incapable of her own distress,
",ACT IV.
3667,"    Or like a creature native and indued
",ACT IV.
3668,"    Unto that element; but long it could not be
",ACT IV.
3669,"    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
",ACT IV.
3670,"    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
",ACT IV.
3671,"    To muddy death.
",ACT IV.
3672,"  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
",ACT IV.
3673,"  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
",ACT IV.
3674,"  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
",ACT IV.
3675,"    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
",ACT IV.
3676,"    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
",ACT IV.
3677,"    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
",ACT IV.
3678,"    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
",ACT IV.
3679,"    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
",ACT IV.
3680,"    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.

3681,"  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.  
",ACT IV.
3682,"    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
",ACT IV.
3683,"    Now fear I this will give it start again;

3684,"    Therefore let's follow.

",ACT V.

",ACT V.
3695,"
",ACT V.
3696,"  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
",ACT V.
3697,"    seeks her own salvation?
",ACT V.
3698,"  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
",ACT V.
3699,"    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
",ACT V.
3700,"  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
",ACT V.
3701,"    defence?
",ACT V.
3702,"  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
",ACT V.
3703,"  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
",ACT V.
3704,"    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and an
",ACT V.
3705,"    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
",ACT V.
3706,"    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
",ACT V.
3707,"  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
",ACT V.
3708,"  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the
",ACT V.
3709,"    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
",ACT V.
3710,"    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to
",ACT V.
3711,"    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
",ACT V.
3712,"    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.  
",ACT V.
3713,"  Other. But is this law?
",ACT V.
3714,"  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
",ACT V.
3715,"  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
",ACT V.
3716,"    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
",ACT V.
3717,"  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk
",ACT V.
3718,"    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves
",ACT V.
3719,"    more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no
",ACT V.
3720,"    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They
",ACT V.
3721,"    hold up Adam's profession.
",ACT V.
3722,"  Other. Was he a gentleman?
",ACT V.
3723,"  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
",ACT V.
3724,"  Other. Why, he had none.
",ACT V.
3725,"  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
",ACT V.
3726,"    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
",ACT V.
3727,"    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
",ACT V.
3728,"    purpose, confess thyself-
",ACT V.
3729,"  Other. Go to!
",ACT V.
3730,"  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
",ACT V.
3731,"    shipwright, or the carpenter?
",ACT V.
3732,"  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand  
",ACT V.
3733,"    tenants.
",ACT V.
3734,"  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well.
",ACT V.
3735,"    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
",ACT V.
3736,"    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
",ACT V.
3737,"    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!
",ACT V.
3738,"  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a

",ACT V.

",ACT V.
3773,"  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
",ACT V.
3774,"    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
",ACT V.
3775,"    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a Politician,
",ACT V.
3776,"    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
",ACT V.
3777,"    might it not?
",ACT V.
3778,"  Hor. It might, my lord.
",ACT V.
3779,"  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
",ACT V.
3780,"    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that

3784,"  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
",ACT V.
3785,"    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,
",ACT V.
3786,"    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
",ACT V.
3787,"    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
",ACT V.
3788,"    on't.
",ACT V.

",ACT V.
3790,"         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,

",ACT V.
3793,"           For such a guest is meet.
",ACT V.
3794,"                                      Throws up [another skull].
",ACT V.
3795,"
",ACT V.
3796,"  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
",ACT V.
3797,"    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
",ACT V.
3798,"    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
",ACT V.
3799,"    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
",ACT V.
3800,"    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a
",ACT V.
3801,"    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
",ACT V.
3802,"    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of
",ACT V.
3803,"    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
",ACT V.
3804,"    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
",ACT V.
3805,"    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
",ACT V.
3806,"    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
",ACT V.
3807,"    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no
",ACT V.
3808,"    more, ha?
",ACT V.
3809,"  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
",ACT V.
3810,"  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
",ACT V.
3811,"  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
",ACT V.
3812,"  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I  
",ACT V.
3813,"    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
",ACT V.
3814,"  Clown. Mine, sir.
",ACT V.
3815,"
",ACT V.
3816,"    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
",ACT V.
3817,"              For such a guest is meet.
",ACT V.
3818,"
",ACT V.
3819,"  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
",ACT V.
3820,"  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
",ACT V.
3821,"    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
",ACT V.
3822,"  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
",ACT V.
3823,"    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
",ACT V.
3824,"  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
",ACT V.
3825,"  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
",ACT V.
3826,"  Clown. For no man, sir.
",ACT V.
3827,"  Ham. What woman then?
",ACT V.
3828,"  Clown. For none neither.
",ACT V.
3829,"  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
",ACT V.
3830,"  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
",ACT V.
3831,"  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
",ACT V.
3832,"    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years
",ACT V.
3833,"    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe  
",ACT V.
3834,"    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
",ACT V.
3835,"    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
",ACT V.
3836,"  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that our
",ACT V.
3837,"    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
",ACT V.
3838,"  Ham. How long is that since?
",ACT V.
3839,"  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the
",ACT V.
3840,"    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
",ACT V.
3841,"    into England.
",ACT V.
3842,"  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
",ACT V.
3843,"  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits there;
",ACT V.
3844,"    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
",ACT V.
3845,"  Ham. Why?
",ACT V.
3846,"  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as mad as
",ACT V.
3847,"    he.
",ACT V.
3848,"  Ham. How came he mad?
",ACT V.
3849,"  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
",ACT V.
3850,"  Ham. How strangely?
",ACT V.
3851,"  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
",ACT V.
3852,"  Ham. Upon what ground?
",ACT V.
3853,"  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy  
",ACT V.
3854,"    thirty years.
",ACT V.
3855,"  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
",ACT V.
3856,"  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many
",ACT V.
3857,"    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in, I
",ACT V.
3858,"    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
",ACT V.
3859,"    you nine year.
",ACT V.
3860,"  Ham. Why he more than another?
",ACT V.
3861,"  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will
",ACT V.
3862,"    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
",ACT V.
3863,"    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien
",ACT V.
3864,"    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
",ACT V.
3865,"  Ham. Whose was it?
",ACT V.
3866,"  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it was?
",ACT V.
3867,"  Ham. Nay, I know not.
",ACT V.
3868,"  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon of
",ACT V.
3869,"    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
",ACT V.
3870,"    skull, the King's jester.
",ACT V.
3871,"  Ham. This?
",ACT V.
3872,"  Clown. E'en that.
",ACT V.
3873,"  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,  
",ACT V.
3874,"    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
",ACT V.
3875,"    hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred
",ACT V.
3876,"    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
",ACT V.
3877,"    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
",ACT V.
3878,"    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
",ACT V.
3879,"    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
",ACT V.
3880,"    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
",ACT V.
3881,"    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
",ACT V.
3882,"    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio,
",ACT V.
3883,"    tell me one thing.
",ACT V.
3884,"  Hor. What's that, my lord?
",ACT V.
3885,"  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
",ACT V.
3886,"  Hor. E'en so.
",ACT V.
3887,"  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
",ACT V.
3888,"                                          [Puts down the skull.]
",ACT V.
3889,"  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
",ACT V.
3890,"  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
",ACT V.
3891,"    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
",ACT V.
3892,"    stopping a bunghole?
",ACT V.
3893,"  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.  
",ACT V.
3894,"  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
",ACT V.
3895,"    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
",ACT V.
3896,"    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
",ACT V.
3897,"    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he
",ACT V.
3898,"    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
",ACT V.
3899,"    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
",ACT V.
3900,"    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
",ACT V.
3901,"    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
",ACT V.
3902,"    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
",ACT V.
3903,"    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-
",ACT V.
3904,"
",ACT V.
3905,"    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
",ACT V.
3906,"             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]
",ACT V.
3907,"
",ACT V.
3908,"    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
",ACT V.
3909,"    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
",ACT V.
3910,"    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
",ACT V.
3911,"    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
",ACT V.
3912,"    Couch we awhile, and mark.
",ACT V.
3913,"                                         [Retires with Horatio.]  
",ACT V.
3914,"  Laer. What ceremony else?
",ACT V.
3915,"  Ham. That is Laertes,
",ACT V.
3916,"    A very noble youth. Mark.
",ACT V.
3917,"  Laer. What ceremony else?
",ACT V.
3918,"  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
",ACT V.
3919,"    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
",ACT V.
3920,"    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
",ACT V.
3921,"    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
",ACT V.
3922,"    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
",ACT V.
3923,"    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
",ACT V.
3924,"    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
",ACT V.
3925,"    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
",ACT V.
3926,"    Of bell and burial.
",ACT V.
3927,"  Laer. Must there no more be done?
",ACT V.
3928,"  Priest. No more be done.
",ACT V.
3929,"    We should profane the service of the dead
",ACT V.
3930,"    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
",ACT V.
3931,"    As to peace-parted souls.
",ACT V.
3932,"  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
",ACT V.
3933,"    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
",ACT V.
3934,"    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
",ACT V.
3935,"    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
",ACT V.
3936,"    When thou liest howling.
",ACT V.
3937,"  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
",ACT V.
3938,"  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
",ACT V.
3939,"                                             [Scatters flowers.]
",ACT V.
3940,"    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
",ACT V.
3941,"    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
",ACT V.
3942,"    And not have strew'd thy grave.
",ACT V.
3943,"  Laer. O, treble woe
",ACT V.
3944,"    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
",ACT V.
3945,"    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
",ACT V.
3946,"    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
",ACT V.
3947,"    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
",ACT V.
3948,"                                             Leaps in the grave.

3956,"    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
",ACT V.
3957,"    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
",ACT V.
3958,"  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
",ACT V.
3959,"                                            [Grapples with him].
",ACT V.
3960,"  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
",ACT V.
3961,"    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
",ACT V.
3962,"    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
",ACT V.
3963,"    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
",ACT V.
3964,"    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
",ACT V.
3965,"  King. Pluck thein asunder.
",ACT V.
3966,"  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
",ACT V.
3967,"  All. Gentlemen!
",ACT V.
3968,"  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
",ACT V.
3969,"             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the

3970,"                                                         grave.]
",ACT V.
3971,"  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
",ACT V.
3972,"    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
",ACT V.
3973,"  Queen. O my son, what theme?  
",ACT V.
3974,"  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
",ACT V.
3975,"    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
",ACT V.
3976,"    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
",ACT V.
3977,"  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
",ACT V.
3978,"  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
",ACT V.
3979,"  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
",ACT V.
3980,"    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
",ACT V.
3981,"    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
",ACT V.
3982,"    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
",ACT V.
3983,"    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
",ACT V.
3984,"    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
",ACT V.
3985,"    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
",ACT V.
3986,"    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
",ACT V.
3987,"    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
",ACT V.
3988,"    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
",ACT V.
3989,"    I'll rant as well as thou.
",ACT V.
3990,"  Queen. This is mere madness;
",ACT V.
3991,"    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
",ACT V.
3992,"    Anon, as patient as the female dove
",ACT V.
3993,"    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,  
",ACT V.
3994,"    His silence will sit drooping.
",ACT V.
3995,"  Ham. Hear you, sir!
",ACT V.
3996,"    What is the reason that you use me thus?
",ACT V.
3997,"    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
",ACT V.
3998,"    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
",ACT V.
3999,"    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.

4001,"  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.

4002,"                                                   Exit Horatio.
",ACT V.
4003,"    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech.
",ACT V.
4004,"    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
",ACT V.
4005,"    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
",ACT V.
4006,"    This grave shall have a living monument.
",ACT V.
4007,"    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
",ACT V.
4008,"    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
",ACT V.
4009,"                                                         Exeunt.

",ACT V.
4014,"Scene II.
",ACT V.
4015,"Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.
",ACT V.
4016,"
",ACT V.
4017,"Enter Hamlet and Horatio.
",ACT V.
4018,"
",ACT V.
4019,"  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
",ACT V.
4020,"    You do remember all the circumstance?
",ACT V.
4021,"  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
",ACT V.
4022,"  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
",ACT V.
4023,"    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
",ACT V.
4024,"    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
",ACT V.
4025,"    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
",ACT V.
4026,"    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
",ACT V.
4027,"    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
",ACT V.
4028,"    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
",ACT V.
4029,"    Rough-hew them how we will-
",ACT V.
4030,"  Hor. That is most certain.
",ACT V.
4031,"  Ham. Up from my cabin,
",ACT V.
4032,"    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
",ACT V.
4033,"    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
",ACT V.
4034,"    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
",ACT V.
4035,"    To mine own room again; making so bold  
",ACT V.
4036,"    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
",ACT V.
4037,"    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
",ACT V.
4038,"    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
",ACT V.
4039,"    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
",ACT V.
4040,"    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
",ACT V.
4041,"    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
",ACT V.
4042,"    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
",ACT V.
4043,"    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
",ACT V.
4044,"    My head should be struck off.
",ACT V.
4045,"  Hor. Is't possible?
",ACT V.
4046,"  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
",ACT V.
4047,"    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
",ACT V.
4048,"  Hor. I beseech you.
",ACT V.
4049,"  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
",ACT V.
4050,"    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
",ACT V.
4051,"    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
",ACT V.
4052,"    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
",ACT V.
4053,"    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
",ACT V.
4054,"    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
",ACT V.
4055,"    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now  
",ACT V.
4056,"    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
",ACT V.
4057,"    Th' effect of what I wrote?
",ACT V.
4058,"  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
",ACT V.
4059,"  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
",ACT V.
4060,"    As England was his faithful tributary,
",ACT V.
4061,"    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
",ACT V.
4062,"    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
",ACT V.
4063,"    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
",ACT V.
4064,"    And many such-like as's of great charge,
",ACT V.
4065,"    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
",ACT V.
4066,"    Without debatement further, more or less,
",ACT V.
4067,"    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
",ACT V.
4068,"    Not shriving time allow'd.
",ACT V.
4069,"  Hor. How was this seal'd?
",ACT V.
4070,"  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
",ACT V.
4071,"    I had my father's signet in my purse,
",ACT V.
4072,"    which was the model of that Danish seal;
",ACT V.
4073,"    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
",ACT V.
4074,"    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
",ACT V.
4075,"    The changeling never known. Now, the next day  
",ACT V.
4076,"    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
",ACT V.
4077,"    Thou know'st already.
",ACT V.
4078,"  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
",ACT V.
4079,"  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
",ACT V.
4080,"    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
",ACT V.
4081,"    Does by their own insinuation grow.
",ACT V.
4082,"    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
",ACT V.
4083,"    Between the pass and fell incensed points
",ACT V.
4084,"    Of mighty opposites.
",ACT V.
4085,"  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
",ACT V.
4086,"  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
",ACT V.
4087,"    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
",ACT V.
4088,"    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
",ACT V.
4089,"    Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,
",ACT V.
4090,"    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
",ACT V.
4091,"    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
",ACT V.
4092,"    To let this canker of our nature come
",ACT V.
4093,"    In further evil?
",ACT V.
4094,"  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
",ACT V.
4095,"    What is the issue of the business there.  
",ACT V.
4096,"  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
",ACT V.
4097,"    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
",ACT V.
4098,"    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
",ACT V.
4099,"    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
",ACT V.
4100,"    For by the image of my cause I see
",ACT V.
4101,"    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
",ACT V.
4102,"    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
",ACT V.
4103,"    Into a tow'ring passion.
",ACT V.
4104,"  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
",ACT V.
4105,"
",ACT V.
4106,"                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.
",ACT V.
4107,"
",ACT V.
4108,"  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
",ACT V.
4109,"  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
",ACT V.
4110,"    waterfly?
",ACT V.
4111,"  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
",ACT V.
4112,"  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
",ACT V.
4113,"    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be
",ACT V.
4114,"    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis
",ACT V.
4115,"    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.  
",ACT V.
4116,"  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart
",ACT V.
4117,"    a thing to you from his Majesty.
",ACT V.
4118,"  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
",ACT V.
4119,"    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
",ACT V.
4120,"  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
",ACT V.
4121,"  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
",ACT V.
4122,"  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
",ACT V.
4123,"  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
",ACT V.
4124,"  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot
",ACT V.
4125,"    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that
",ACT V.
4126,"    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter-
",ACT V.
4127,"  Ham. I beseech you remember.
",ACT V.
4128,"                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
",ACT V.
4129,"  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
",ACT V.
4130,"    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,
",ACT V.
4131,"    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
",ACT V.
4132,"    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
",ACT V.
4133,"    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of
",ACT V.
4134,"    what part a gentleman would see.
",ACT V.
4135,"  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I  
",ACT V.
4136,"    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of
",ACT V.
4137,"    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
",ACT V.
4138,"    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
",ACT V.
4139,"    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
",ACT V.
4140,"    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
",ACT V.
4141,"    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
",ACT V.
4142,"  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
",ACT V.
4143,"  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
",ACT V.
4144,"    rawer breath
",ACT V.
4145,"  Osr. Sir?
",ACT V.
4146,"  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
",ACT V.
4147,"    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
",ACT V.
4148,"  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
",ACT V.
4149,"  Osr. Of Laertes?
",ACT V.
4150,"  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
",ACT V.
4151,"    spent.
",ACT V.
4152,"  Ham. Of him, sir.
",ACT V.
4153,"  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
",ACT V.
4154,"  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
",ACT V.
4155,"    much approve me. Well, sir?  
",ACT V.
4156,"  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
",ACT V.
4157,"  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
",ACT V.
4158,"    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
",ACT V.
4159,"  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
",ACT V.
4160,"    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
",ACT V.
4161,"  Ham. What's his weapon?
",ACT V.
4162,"  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
",ACT V.
4163,"  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
",ACT V.
4164,"  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
",ACT V.
4165,"    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
",ACT V.
4166,"    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
",ACT V.
4167,"    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
",ACT V.
4168,"    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
",ACT V.
4169,"    very liberal conceit.
",ACT V.
4170,"  Ham. What call you the carriages?
",ACT V.
4171,"  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
",ACT V.
4172,"    ere you had done.
",ACT V.
4173,"  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
",ACT V.
4174,"  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
",ACT V.
4175,"    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.  
",ACT V.
4176,"    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
",ACT V.
4177,"    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French
",ACT V.
4178,"    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?
",ACT V.
4179,"  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
",ACT V.
4180,"    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
",ACT V.
4181,"    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
",ACT V.
4182,"    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
",ACT V.
4183,"  Ham. How if I answer no?
",ACT V.
4184,"  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
",ACT V.
4185,"  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
",ACT V.
4186,"    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
",ACT V.
4187,"    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,
",ACT V.
4188,"    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
",ACT V.
4189,"    shame and the odd hits.
",ACT V.
4190,"  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
",ACT V.
4191,"  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
",ACT V.
4192,"  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
",ACT V.
4193,"  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
",ACT V.
4194,"    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
",ACT V.
4195,"  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  
",ACT V.
4196,"  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
",ACT V.
4197,"    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
",ACT V.
4198,"    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-
",ACT V.
4199,"    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
",ACT V.
4200,"    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
",ACT V.
4201,"    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
",ACT V.
4202,"
",ACT V.
4203,"                            Enter a Lord.
",ACT V.
4204,"
",ACT V.
4205,"  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
",ACT V.
4206,"    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
",ACT V.
4207,"    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
",ACT V.
4208,"    take longer time.
",ACT V.
4209,"  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
",ACT V.
4210,"    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
",ACT V.
4211,"    I be so able as now.
",ACT V.
4212,"  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
",ACT V.
4213,"  Ham. In happy time.
",ACT V.
4214,"  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
",ACT V.
4215,"    Laertes before you fall to play.  
",ACT V.
4216,"  Ham. She well instructs me.
",ACT V.
4217,"                                                    [Exit Lord.]
",ACT V.
4218,"  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
",ACT V.
4219,"  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
",ACT V.
4220,"    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
",ACT V.
4221,"    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
",ACT V.
4222,"  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
",ACT V.
4223,"  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
",ACT V.
4224,"    would perhaps trouble a woman.
",ACT V.
4225,"  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
",ACT V.
4226,"    repair hither and say you are not fit.
",ACT V.
4227,"  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
",ACT V.
4228,"    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be
",ACT V.
4229,"    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
",ACT V.
4230,"    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,
",ACT V.
4231,"    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.
",ACT V.
4232,"
",ACT V.
4233,"    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
",ACT V.
4234,"              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
",ACT V.
4235,"               A table and flagons of wine on it.  
",ACT V.
4236,"
",ACT V.
4237,"  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
",ACT V.
4238,"                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
",ACT V.
4239,"  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
",ACT V.
4240,"    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
",ACT V.
4241,"    This presence knows,
",ACT V.
4242,"    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
",ACT V.
4243,"    With sore distraction. What I have done
",ACT V.
4244,"    That might your nature, honour, and exception
",ACT V.
4245,"    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
",ACT V.
4246,"    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
",ACT V.
4247,"    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
",ACT V.
4248,"    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
",ACT V.
4249,"    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
",ACT V.
4250,"    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
",ACT V.
4251,"    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
",ACT V.
4252,"    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
",ACT V.
4253,"    Sir, in this audience,
",ACT V.
4254,"    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
",ACT V.
4255,"    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts  
",ACT V.
4256,"    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
",ACT V.
4257,"    And hurt my brother.
",ACT V.
4258,"  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
",ACT V.
4259,"    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
",ACT V.
4260,"    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
",ACT V.
4261,"    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
",ACT V.
4262,"    Till by some elder masters of known honour
",ACT V.
4263,"    I have a voice and precedent of peace
",ACT V.
4264,"    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
",ACT V.
4265,"    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
",ACT V.
4266,"    And will not wrong it.
",ACT V.
4267,"  Ham. I embrace it freely,
",ACT V.
4268,"    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
",ACT V.
4269,"    Give us the foils. Come on.
",ACT V.
4270,"  Laer. Come, one for me.
",ACT V.
4271,"  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
",ACT V.
4272,"    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
",ACT V.
4273,"    Stick fiery off indeed.
",ACT V.
4274,"  Laer. You mock me, sir.
",ACT V.
4275,"  Ham. No, by this bad.  
",ACT V.
4276,"  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
",ACT V.
4277,"    You know the wager?
",ACT V.
4278,"  Ham. Very well, my lord.
",ACT V.
4279,"    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
",ACT V.
4280,"  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
",ACT V.
4281,"    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
",ACT V.
4282,"  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
",ACT V.
4283,"  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
",ACT V.
4284,"                                                Prepare to play.
",ACT V.
4285,"  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
",ACT V.
4286,"  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
",ACT V.
4287,"    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
",ACT V.
4288,"    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
",ACT V.
4289,"    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
",ACT V.
4290,"    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
",ACT V.
4291,"    And in the cup an union shall he throw
",ACT V.
4292,"    Richer than that which four successive kings
",ACT V.
4293,"    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
",ACT V.
4294,"    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
",ACT V.
4295,"    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,  
",ACT V.
4296,"    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
",ACT V.
4297,"    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
",ACT V.
4298,"    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
",ACT V.
4299,"  Ham. Come on, sir.
",ACT V.
4300,"  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
",ACT V.
4301,"  Ham. One.
",ACT V.
4302,"  Laer. No.
",ACT V.
4303,"  Ham. Judgment!
",ACT V.
4304,"  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
",ACT V.
4305,"  Laer. Well, again!
",ACT V.
4306,"  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
",ACT V.
4307,"    Here's to thy health.
",ACT V.
4308,"               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
",ACT V.
4309,"    Give him the cup.
",ACT V.
4310,"  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
",ACT V.
4311,"    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
",ACT V.
4312,"  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
",ACT V.
4313,"  King. Our son shall win.
",ACT V.
4314,"  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
",ACT V.
4315,"    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.  
",ACT V.
4316,"    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
",ACT V.
4317,"  Ham. Good madam!
",ACT V.
4318,"  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
",ACT V.
4319,"  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
",ACT V.
4320,"  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
",ACT V.
4321,"  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
",ACT V.
4322,"  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
",ACT V.
4323,"  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
",ACT V.
4324,"  King. I do not think't.
",ACT V.
4325,"  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
",ACT V.
4326,"  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
",ACT V.
4327,"    pray You Pass with your best violence;
",ACT V.
4328,"    I am afeard You make a wanton of me.
",ACT V.
4329,"  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
",ACT V.
4330,"  Osr. Nothing neither way.
",ACT V.
4331,"  Laer. Have at you now!
",ACT V.
4332,"                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
",ACT V.
4333,"                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
",ACT V.
4334,"  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
",ACT V.
4335,"  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.  
",ACT V.
4336,"  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
",ACT V.
4337,"  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
",ACT V.
4338,"  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
",ACT V.
4339,"  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
",ACT V.
4340,"    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
",ACT V.
4341,"  Ham. How does the Queen?
",ACT V.
4342,"  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
",ACT V.
4343,"  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
",ACT V.
4344,"    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
",ACT V.
4345,"  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
",ACT V.
4346,"    Treachery! Seek it out.
",ACT V.
4347,"                                                [Laertes falls.]
",ACT V.
4348,"  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
",ACT V.
4349,"    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
",ACT V.
4350,"    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
",ACT V.
4351,"    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
",ACT V.
4352,"    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
",ACT V.
4353,"    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
",ACT V.
4354,"    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
",ACT V.
4355,"    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.  
",ACT V.
4356,"  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
",ACT V.
4357,"    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
",ACT V.
4358,"  All. Treason! treason!
",ACT V.
4359,"  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
",ACT V.
4360,"  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
",ACT V.
4361,"    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
",ACT V.
4362,"    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
",ACT V.
4363,"  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
",ACT V.
4364,"    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
",ACT V.
4365,"    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
",ACT V.
4366,"    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
",ACT V.
4367,"    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
",ACT V.
4368,"  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
",ACT V.
4369,"    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
",ACT V.
4370,"    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
",ACT V.
4371,"    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
",ACT V.
4372,"    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
",ACT V.
4373,"    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
",ACT V.
4374,"    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
",ACT V.
4375,"    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright  
",ACT V.
4376,"    To the unsatisfied.
",ACT V.
4377,"  Hor. Never believe it.
",ACT V.
4378,"    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
",ACT V.
4379,"    Here's yet some liquor left.
",ACT V.
4380,"  Ham. As th'art a man,
",ACT V.
4381,"    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
",ACT V.
4382,"    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
",ACT V.
4383,"    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
",ACT V.
4384,"    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
",ACT V.
4385,"    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
",ACT V.
4386,"    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
",ACT V.
4387,"    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
",ACT V.
4388,"    What warlike noise is this?
",ACT V.
4389,"  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
",ACT V.
4390,"    To the ambassadors of England gives
",ACT V.
4391,"    This warlike volley.
",ACT V.
4392,"  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
",ACT V.
4393,"    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
",ACT V.
4394,"    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
",ACT V.
4395,"    But I do prophesy th' election lights  
",ACT V.
4396,"    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
",ACT V.
4397,"    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
",ACT V.
4398,"    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
",ACT V.
4399,"  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
",ACT V.
4400,"    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
",ACT V.
4401,"                                                 [March within.]
",ACT V.
4402,"    Why does the drum come hither?
",ACT V.
4403,"
",ACT V.
4404,"    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
",ACT V.
4405,"                  Colours, and Attendants.
",ACT V.
4406,"
",ACT V.
4407,"  Fort. Where is this sight?
",ACT V.
4408,"  Hor. What is it you will see?
",ACT V.
4409,"    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
",ACT V.
4410,"  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
",ACT V.
4411,"    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
",ACT V.
4412,"    That thou so many princes at a shot
",ACT V.
4413,"    So bloodily hast struck.
",ACT V.
4414,"  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
",ACT V.
4415,"    And our affairs from England come too late.  
",ACT V.
4416,"    The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
",ACT V.
4417,"    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
",ACT V.
4418,"    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
",ACT V.
4419,"    Where should We have our thanks?
",ACT V.
4420,"  Hor. Not from his mouth,
",ACT V.
4421,"    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
",ACT V.
4422,"    He never gave commandment for their death.
",ACT V.
4423,"    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
",ACT V.
4424,"    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
",ACT V.
4425,"    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
",ACT V.
4426,"    High on a stage be placed to the view;
",ACT V.
4427,"    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
",ACT V.
4428,"    How these things came about. So shall You hear
",ACT V.
4429,"    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
",ACT V.
4430,"    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
",ACT V.
4431,"    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
",ACT V.
4432,"    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
",ACT V.
4433,"    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
",ACT V.
4434,"    Truly deliver.
",ACT V.
4435,"  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,  
",ACT V.
4436,"    And call the noblest to the audience.
",ACT V.
4437,"    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
",ACT V.
4438,"    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
",ACT V.
4439,"    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
",ACT V.
4440,"  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
",ACT V.
4441,"    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
",ACT V.
4442,"    But let this same be presently perform'd,
",ACT V.
4443,"    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
",ACT V.
4444,"    On plots and errors happen.
",ACT V.
4445,"  Fort. Let four captains
",ACT V.
4446,"    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
",ACT V.
4447,"    For he was likely, had he been put on,
",ACT V.
4448,"    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
",ACT V.
4449,"    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
",ACT V.
4450,"    Speak loudly for him.
",ACT V.
4451,"    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
",ACT V.
4452,"    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
",ACT V.
4453,"    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
",ACT V.
4454,"            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
",ACT V.
4455,"                                                   are shot off.
